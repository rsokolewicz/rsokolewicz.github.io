She was the first visionary to realize that AI needs &lt;strong>a lot&lt;/strong> of data to become useful. She started a very ambitious project with ImageNet, which was a database with over a million images, all labeled and categorized. She was also one of the first to heavily make use of the mechanical turk program to have a lof of people work in parallel labeling images over the course of a few years. The book covers her life and journey, her life in China, the struggles of growing up as a girl that loves science where teachers failed to acknowledge and support her. As a teenager she moved to the United States with her parents, and then later on she studied physics at Princeton and Caltech. After her PhD she started working on ImageNet, and created a competition to have people submit their best image recognition algorithms. While the first few years were a bit disappointing where most of the submissions were simple regression algorithms with mediocre performance, finally in 2012 the ImageNet competition was won by the deep convolutional neural network, AlexNet, which started the whole AI revolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book is very nicely written, very personal and using visual storytelling and a great book for everyone who is interested in AI to read.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>[8.0/10] Richard Feynman's Six not so easy pieces</title><link>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/5_6_not_so_easy_pieces/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/5_6_not_so_easy_pieces/</guid><description>In a small second hand store I was browsing books and there I saw this book for only €1.50!

It&amp;rsquo;s a distillation from a few chapters from his famous &lt;em>The Feynman Lectures&lt;/em> and concern special and general relativity. As a physicist both the author and the topics excite me, so I managed to read through it quite quickly. For non-physicists I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend the book as it is quite technical (though everyone online contradict me), but for anyone either studying or have studied physics it&amp;rsquo;s a good read. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to reminisce some of the topics I studied at university, but at the same time I got a bit annoyed. Feynman explains the need for each theory and also which symmetries of nature we put into the theory. Everything is done with very little math with a focus on understanding everything intuitively. The reason why it&amp;rsquo;s a bit upsetting, is that I realize how bad some of the lectures at university were. Special relativity was taught to me as more or less: &amp;ldquo;Einstein says light speed is constant for all observers, let&amp;rsquo;s see what that means&amp;rdquo;. No discussion around the history, no discussion around Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s equations, no mention of the fact that length contraction and time dilation were already known (with an incorrect interpretation). Same for general relativity. It was taught by introducing tensors, some tensor algebra rules and we spent 3 months calculating Ricci tensors, Levi-Civita symbols, covariant derivatives. I managed to pass the exam without understanding anything, by just memorizing some math rules. It was so dramatic that after 3 months I still didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what a tensor was, apart from that if it transforms like a tensor, it is a tensor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course later on you read some stuff online, watch some youtube videos and you slowly learn the history and intuition behind it. But why not teach it properly the first time?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, the book can be summarized with the following ideas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>All mechanics should not depend on which units you use, nor where you place the origin of the coordinate system you measure in. In a sense, this means that if I want to understand the game of billiards from a physics perspective it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if I use grams or ounces, nor does it matter if I stand on one side of the table, or the other. I can even walk around the room while taking measurements, and the laws of physics should remain the same. We call this Galilean invariance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Einstein (in part also Poincaré) comes along and says: not only mechanics, but all of physics should remain invariant. If I sit in a car, or in a spaceship I should not be able to create any experiment that can tell me how fast I&amp;rsquo;m moving (without looking outside). This is called the relativity principle. From here we can choose two philosophical paths:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The speed of light is constant. And from there we derive a new set of rules that are called Lorentzian invariance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can show that the relativity principle implies either Galilean invariance, or Lorentzian invariance. Then experimentally we see we need to choose Lorentzian invariance, and that the constant c that appears must be (up to experimental precision) identical to the speed of light.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And finally, Einstein in another stroke of brilliance says: not only should all of physics be the same when moving with a constant velocity, it should also be the same both in a falling elevator, and in an accelerating spaceship. In a sense equating acceleration to gravity and claiming that they are one and the same. This is called the principle of equivalence.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So in short, most of modern physics was invented by a few philosophical leaps: starting from the fact that all of mechanics should be the same (at constant velocity), to all of physics should be the same (at constant velocity), and finally to the idea that all of physics should be the same in gravity and when accelerating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Presenting it this way gives me a much better appreciation of physics, but it also shows how special and general relativity follows quite naturally from classical mechanics. Something quite fundamental, but still missing from my education unfortunately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides these ideas Feynman also goes a bit more into detail of time and space dilation, why clocks move slower in stronger gravity (think of the movie interstellar) and what it means that space has a &amp;ldquo;geometry&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>[8/10] Max Tegman's Life 3.0</title><link>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/8_life3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/8_life3/</guid><description/><content/></item><item><title>[5/10] Nick Bostrom's Superintelligence</title><link>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/7_superintelligence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/7_superintelligence/</guid><description>The book explores the idea of &amp;ldquo;superintelligence&amp;rdquo;, an intelligence that is above that of human in all regards.

Nick tries to be rather complete in his exploration and defines different types and aspects of superintelligence, and then explores the implications for our future. Initially I was quite excited with the book. It seemed to be quite diverse and in-depth, and it was written right before the large-language-model boom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, the book is quite dense and technical and I found it difficult to read. Most of the content was quite interesting, but it was hard to push through it and in the end I skipped a few chapters. It starts of with defining different sorts of superintelligence. For example, a single computer that can outsmart humans on all tasks, or perhaps a network or collection of intelligences? The network he calls &amp;ldquo;collective superintelligence&amp;rdquo;, which I found an interesting idea. Now that we have large-language-models producing content online and sometimes even engaging with each other, it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to imagine how the internet will look like in the near future. As each AI becomes smarter and more capable, the internet will have a life of its own. Other examples of superintelligence could be genetically enhanced humans, consciousness uploaded to computers, cyborgs and a few other ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far so good. Nick then continues to explore different pathways how these various kinds of superintelligences can emerge. I was less convinced here and it seemed more like science fiction, than anything else. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t wrong or unbelievable, but it felt like a random collection of ideas without giving merit to any of them. He does argue however that the leap from moderate intelligence, to superintelligence can happen exponentially fast. The idea is also shared with Max Tegmark in his &amp;ldquo;Life 3.0&amp;rdquo;, at a certain moment an AI can design a better version of itself, and this can repeat indefinitely, and very quickly. However, looking at what is called the &amp;ldquo;chinchilla scaling laws&amp;rdquo;, it seems to me that we have lots of bottlenecks that prevent this fast emergence of intelligence from ever happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main argument of Nick here is that the &amp;ldquo;recalcitrance&amp;rdquo; of AI, i.e. its resistance to improve, is likely to be lower than the &amp;ldquo;optimization power&amp;rdquo; of artificial AI. For human superintelligence (e.g. spending a few hundred years selective breeding the most intelligent humans), our DNA might be an early bottleneck preventing any further boost to our intelligence. For artificial AI however, Nick argues that the optimization power is always higher than the recalcitrance, leading to a &amp;ldquo;fast takeoff&amp;rdquo; where superintelligence is reached in a very short time. This is sounds familiar to the movie Terminator, where computers become self-aware and in no time able to take over the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, I&amp;rsquo;m not very convinced by this argument. Looking at large language models, we have to throw so much compute at it and we&amp;rsquo;re already close to the limit of how big these models can get. Data becomes a limiting factor and you can&amp;rsquo;t expect the model to have a lower cross entropy loss than the entropy of natural language itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I stopped reading soon after this. As I mentioned before, the text is written in aa dense and technical way, and reminds me a bit of reading academic papers. I got recommended to read Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark instead, which shares many ideas and is written in a more accessible way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So to end this review: content wise I think it was quite interesting, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very pleasurable to read before sleeping. If you read slowly, spend time contemplating the content, I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s worth a read, but these days I&amp;rsquo;m too impatient for that :D&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>[7/10] Kazuo Ishiguro's Klara and the sun</title><link>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/6_clara_and_the_sun/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/6_clara_and_the_sun/</guid><description>A science fiction book based in a time where children grow up with an AI best friend.

They are there to comfort the children, help them develop and give them strength and security to tackle the adult world once they grow up. We follow the robot friend Klara, and their human friend Josie, throughout Josie&amp;rsquo;s childhood. Through the eyes of Klara we learn about the world they live in, the social interactions between humans and AI and her observations act as a looking glass and a reflection on our own society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the story unfolds through the eyes of Klara, we experience the story from Josie&amp;rsquo;s perspective as well. While Klara tries to understand the world in her own way, as the reader you know what is actually going on. For example, Josie is upset after a fight with her neighbor boy, and even though we don&amp;rsquo;t have all the details it&amp;rsquo;s clear what happened and why Josie feels that way. But then Klara tries to understand it in her own way. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting perspective to try to make sense of emotions in a rational way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We see how Josie grows up with Klara and shows us one of the possible future of how AI will integrate with our lives. Unfortunately, the world building surrounding AI was a bit lacking. Although most rich kids have a robot friend, we see little interaction between Klara and them. The story is focussed on Josie and Klara.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit of a dystopian feeling that I always have about the future with AI, is also present in this book: because the children grow up with an AI best friend, they lack social skills to interact with each other. Because all the kids want one, it not only creates a social divide between rich kids and poor kids, it creates this feedback loop every new generation of AI is the new thing, rich kids get dependent on it and it becomes a necessity, rather than a cool thing to have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all a nice story, but I would&amp;rsquo;ve appreciated more if the world building was more expanded. We only see AI in the form of best friends for children that get discarded when they grow up, but we do not see how AI is integrated in other aspects of life.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>[8/10] Vladimir Khorikov's Unit Testing: Principles, Practices, and Patterns</title><link>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/11_unit_testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/11_unit_testing/</guid><description/><content/></item><item><title>[7/10] Brené Brown's Daring Greatly</title><link>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/4_daring_greatly/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/4_daring_greatly/</guid><description>Summary In Daring Greatly, Brené Brown writes about how shame and vulnerability, or more importantly how we deal with it, define who we are and how it shapes our future.

&lt;p>In Daring Greatly, Brené Brown writes about how shame and vulnerability, or more
importantly how we deal with it, define who we are and how it shapes our future.
Although everyone has experience with shame and vulnerability, everyone
understands it in a different way. Brené has worked as a researcher on this
topic for many years, and in research it is always important to work with
definitions. The way she defines shame is as &lt;em>the fear of not belonging&lt;/em>. It is
the feeling we get when do something wrong, when we forget someone&amp;rsquo;s birthday or
when we are running late. It is written in our DNA that we are social animals,
or as Brené writes&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We are hardwired to connect with others, it&amp;rsquo;s what gives purpose and meaning to
our lives, and without it there is suffering.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And (un)luckily for us evolution has given us a number of tools to ensure that
we build and sustain this connection. Shame is one of those tools, which drives and
pushes us towards behavior that we expect to benefit social connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But as we all know and experienced, shame is not a nice feeling to have and
often it does not work in our best interest. Feelings of shame can prevent us
from giving presentations, speaking up during meetings, talking to that cute
girl at a party, or trying out new hobbies. This however does not mean that we
should seek to become resistant to shame. Brené argues that the goal is to
become shame &lt;em>resilient&lt;/em>. Despite feeling shameful and vulnerable, and despite
all the discomfort, we should all dare greatly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the book, Brené starts by discussing how today&amp;rsquo;s society has caused all
of us to be taken hold of shame. We live in a time where nothing is ever enough,
we do not have enough time, not enough money, not enough holidays, not enough
clothing, not enough movies. It is never enough, but we do feel better than
those who have less than us. Those who have money can look down on people who
do not have it, those who are smart look down on people who are dumb. Of course,
not everyone is like this, but we feel like this is true. Growing up poor will
make you feel shameful because of the idea that others will look down on you.
And this whole notion of not being good enough stems from what Brené calls the
&lt;em>scarcity culture&lt;/em>. It is not only about what we have but also what we do. We
want to be fun and feel bad if we&amp;rsquo;re not fun at a party, or if no one laughs at
our jokes. In a &lt;em>scarcity culture&lt;/em>, Brené says&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The greatest casualties [&amp;hellip;] are our willingness to own our vulnerabilities
and our ability to engage with the world from a place of worthiness&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>However, feeling shameful, being exposed and being vulnerable does not make you
weak, Brené says. We let our fear of disconnection become disapproval and
critique, but is it not courageous and respectful if we own up to our
vulnerability? In relationships, we share our insecurities and fears and we allow
ourselves to be vulnerable. Does to love and to be loved, make you weak? Of
course not, Brené says. As the book title says, it is all about daring greatly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of us have over time developed strategies and behaviors to prevent us from
feeling shameful. This ranges from wearing imaginary masks, setting up shields
and walls, distracting ourselves or even using anger to overrun our feelings of
shame. We spend the entire evening binge-watching a series instead of working on
a report, we start to excessively help people out with tasks, or we start
blaming and shaming others. This however does not offer us true protection. The
mask eventually falls off and the shield will break at some point and the shame
we were trying to run away from is still there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the workforce and relationships, shame also plays an important role. In
companies where cultures exist where management shames, blames and criticizes
their workers, we see disengagement, lack of motivation, stress and general
unhappiness. Not only that, it also negatively impacts productivity and
creativity. Fear leads to risk aversion and that leads to lower innovation. Or
in Brené&amp;rsquo;s words:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;that deep fear we all have of being wrong, of being belittled and of feeling
less than, is what stops us taking the very risks required to move our companies
forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A good company culture, in Brene&amp;rsquo;s view, is one where both work and workers are
&amp;ldquo;humanized&amp;rdquo;, where shame is both recognized and fought, and the dignity and
vulnerability of each individual are held high.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The topic is interesting and relevant and Brené managed to catch my attention
very fast at the start of the book with relevant examples and lot&amp;rsquo;s of moments
where I recognized myself in what she was describing. The feelings, the fears,
the emotions that we all experience when we feel shameful is all written in a
clear manner. However, the remainder of the book seemed a bit unclear and less
relevant. The last chapter for example is about parenting and about how Brené
and her husband raise their kids. The story is often unstructured and full of
personal anecdotes that do not seem entirely relevant, making you often feel
lost. One topic I was hoping Brené would discuss more is how shame is perceived
and used in different cultures. The personal anecdotes that she shares for
example sometimes feel too American to be relevant to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book also focuses too much on the negative aspects of shame,
with little room for the positive aspects: too much shames leads to various
coping mechanisms, while in other cases we have to practice mindfulness and
accept the feeling for what it is, just a feeling. The goal, Brené says, is not
shame-resistance but shame-resilience. In that sense, the advice given in this
book is the same as in most other self-help books, to practice compassion and
mindfulness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Content-wise, I quite enjoyed the book although my enthusiasm went down as I
went through the book. The pacing and structuring of the book made it a bit
difficult to finish, but I got enough out of it to make me think and recognize
shame in my daily life. The short discussion on work cultures was very
recognizable as doing a PhD is typically driven by fear, shame and guilt. While
at my other jobs there is a more healthy relationship with your coworkers and
superiors. The fear of making mistakes, losing face and reputation, and
appearing weak is very relevant on the work floor (at least to me) and
recognizing it early on helps us deal with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="quotes-from-the-book">quotes from the book&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>when we were children we used to think that when we were grown up we would no
longer be vulnerable. But to grow up is to accept vulnerability. To be alive is
to be vulnerable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>leadership is scarce because few people are willing to go through the discomfort
required to lead.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>yes, we are totally exposed when we are vulnerable. Yes, we are in the torture
chamber that we call uncertainty. And, yes, we&amp;rsquo;re taking a huge emotional risk
when we allow ourselves to be vulnerable. But there&amp;rsquo;s no equation where taking
risks, braving uncertainty, and opening ourselves up to emotional exposure
equals weakness.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>in an organized culture where respect and the dignity of the individuals are
held as the highest values, shame and blame don&amp;rsquo;t work as management styles.
there is no leading by fear. empathy is a values asset, accountability is an
expectation rather than an exception and the primal human need for belonging is
not used as leverage and social control. we can&amp;rsquo;t control the behavior of
individuals; however we can cultivate organizational cultures where behaviors
are not tolerated and people are held accountable for practicing what matters
most: human beings.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>this notion that the leader needs to be &amp;ldquo;in charge&amp;rdquo; and to &amp;ldquo;know al the answers&amp;rdquo;
is both dated and destructive. Its impact on others is the sense that hey know
less and that they are less than. A recipe for risk aversion if ever i have
heard it. Shame becomes fear. Fear leads to risk aversion. Risk aversion kills
innovation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>shame resilience is the ability to say &amp;ldquo;this hurts. this is disappointing, maybe
even devastating. but success and recognition and approval are not the values
that drive me my value is courage and i was just courageous. you can move on,
shame.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The book explores many psychological factors that play a role in athletic
performance. Self-esteem for example is not driven by rewards and punishment but
is derived from personal growth. The &lt;em>fake it till you make it&lt;/em> mentality is
also something that is proven to not work. It works in the short term in
low-challenge situations but is completely ineffective in more demanding
situations

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>)&lt;/span>. Similarly, overconfidence is also shown to be detrimental.
True self-esteem and true confidence are the product of
self-awareness: being true to yourself and the ability to choose appropriate
goals to maintain motivation and overcome obstacles. Confidence and esteem,
then, come from effectively utilizing one&amp;rsquo;s capabilities, rather than relying on
superficial beliefs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Emotions and feelings are discussed as valuable indicators of one&amp;rsquo;s health and
state of mind. The book explains how naming and understanding these emotions can
provide a sense of control and aid in problem-solving. It highlights the
benefits of utilizing anxiety and pressure as motivators, rather than allowing
them to hinder progress

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>)&lt;/span>. Similar to mindfulness,
stoicism, and yoga, equanimity is not about suppression of feelings or
indifference, but rather about a balanced approach to experience, meaning that
one does not fall into emotional extremes because of worldly winds such as
praise and blame, success and failure, pleasure and pain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is somewhat in contrast to cognitive narrowing, where one&amp;rsquo;s focus and
attention become too concentrated at the expense of other stimuli in the
environment. Not only does this have negative effects on rumination, and
decision-making, but it can also lead to depression.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In essence, we are encouraged to embrace challenges, seek personal growth, and
develop resilience through self-awareness, autonomy, and a sense of purpose. By
adopting these principles, individuals can navigate difficulties and develop
&amp;ldquo;real toughness&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thoughts">thoughts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The book contains a nice balance between light-weight anecdotes and
the more heavy descriptions of psychological experiments and scientific facts.
The content seems well-researched and established and it seems that Steve knows
what he talks about. The book was not quite what I expected it to be. I expected
more about physical training, diets and overall the effect on the body and mind
of &lt;em>doing hard things&lt;/em>. As mentioned in the summary, the book leans heavily on
mental health. It is somewhat surprising that a healthy and strong mind is a
necessity for top-performing athletes, though it does remind me of e.g. what Andre
Agassi wrote in his biography &lt;em>Open&lt;/em>: that he lost important matches because
his head wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the right place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steve proposes several &amp;ldquo;pillars&amp;rdquo; that need to be built to cultivate toughness.
Most of these pillars are mantras, or advice to achieve a sort of mental
calmness. These pillars can be found in many self-help books, so most of it was not
new to me, but it was a nice refresher in the new context of high-performance
athletics. The last pillar, for example, to find meaning in discomfort comes from
Viktor Frankl&amp;rsquo;s book Man&amp;rsquo;s Search for Meaning.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>)&lt;/span>, the phenomenon often described as a sensation of
listlessness, extreme apathy and hopelessness where an individual loses the
will to live and dies, even if there is nothing physically wrong with them.
Steve gives an example from one of the first settlements in the Americas,
Jamestown, where a large portion of the population died due to &amp;ldquo;apathy,
idleness and laziness&amp;rdquo;. In the first year, only 38 out of the 108 original
settlers survived, and in the next decade, the odds of survival did not
improve much. That is, until James Smith arrived and created the rule that
every man must work on the farms for four hours a day, under the new motto
&amp;ldquo;work or starve&amp;rdquo;. As explained by John Leach, &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;That sensation of choice
indicates a reversal of mental defeat and the reimposition of some personal
control over the situation which is a key factor in recovery. . . .
(Give-up-itis) is the clinical expression of mental defeat; in particular, it
is a pathology of a normal, passive coping response.&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. This is also explained

&lt;p>The self-esteem movement in the US, e.g. getting trophies and awards for
everything, was strongly influenced by the politician John Vasconcellos. He
envisioned that a lack of self-esteem is the biggest contributor to many
pressing problems in the USA: drugs, crime, depression, poverty and family
problems. He argued that if every US citizen would feel worthy and valuable then
they could all reach their full potential and all the problems mentioned above
would naturally disappear. He assigned a sociologist, Neil Smelser, to head a
task force tasked with investigating the impact of self-esteem

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>)&lt;/span>. After a
preliminary report by Smelser, Vasconcellos was convinced: &lt;em>“Self-esteem is the
likeliest candidate for a social vaccine, something that empowers us to live
responsibly and that inoculates us against the lures of crime, violence,
substance abuse, teen pregnancy, child abuse, chronic welfare dependency, and
educational failure.”&lt;/em>. Unfortunately, Vasconcellos was all wrong and he based
this conclusion not on the actual outcomes of Smelser&amp;rsquo;s main conclusions but on
a small unrelated segment of his research. Nonetheless, Vasconcellos managed to
convince politicians, the media and the public that raising self-esteem was an
absolute must. Soon after, school programs and promotional campaigns were set up
to ensure every American individual would be steaming with self-esteem.
Unfortunately, this only works if self-esteem comes from within, not
through external factors, and by doing actual hard work.&lt;/p>

personal experiences growing up as a Chinese-Dutch in the Netherlands. Pete was
born and raised in the Netherlands, but his Chinese heritage often made him feel
like an outsider. He struggled to find his identity as someone who was &amp;ldquo;Chinese
on the outside, white on the inside&amp;rdquo;, i.e. like a &amp;ldquo;banana&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Growing up, Pete felt resentment towards his Chineseness, and he struggled to
reconcile his dual identity. Through his book, Pete seeks to answer the question
of what it means to grow up as a Chinese-Dutch. He shares the details of his
childhood and interviews many others who grew up with Chinese parents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One aspect that Pete discusses in his book is the emotional distance he felt
from his parents. The lack of a &amp;ldquo;talking&amp;rdquo; culture in China, combined with his
parents&amp;rsquo; long working hours and the language barrier, made it difficult for him
to connect with them. He felt like he couldn&amp;rsquo;t fully express himself, and this
led to a sense of distance in their relationship. This is a common experience
for many children of immigrant parents, as cultural differences and language
barriers can create challenges in communication and understanding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the stories Pete shares in his book is about his father. He recalls his
dad telling him, &amp;ldquo;I never say that I&amp;rsquo;m proud of you because I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that by
doing so you will work less hard.&amp;rdquo; This statement highlights the cultural
differences between Chinese and Dutch parenting, where the former tends to be
more reserved in expressing emotions and praise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pete also discusses the cultural differences he experienced. In Chinese culture,
you don&amp;rsquo;t open up in general, which made it challenging for him to express his
feelings. Furthermore, he was constantly reminded that he was not considered
Dutch enough. People would often ask him where he learned Dutch or if he knew
kung fu, which were micro-aggressions that made him feel excluded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing that struck Pete while writing the book was realizing how much his
parents had given up by coming to the Netherlands. They left behind their home
and family in China to give their children a better life. This realization made
him appreciate his heritage and identity more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout the book, Pete also discusses the representation of Chinese people on
Dutch TV, which was often limited to stereotypical roles. He hopes that his book
will help break down these stereotypes and encourage people to embrace their
differences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s quite an interesting read. As the son of Polish parents, I noticed some
familiarities with Pete&amp;rsquo;s story, but my experience was completely different. My
friends would sometimes joke about being Polish, but growing up I never felt
treated differently (looking and sounding Dutch helps of course).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People often ask me if I feel more Polish or more Dutch, to which I usually
answer that I feel neither. I wonder how Pete would feel if he grew up in an
environment where looking Asian doesn&amp;rsquo;t receive special treatment. Growing up as
a kid, it is important to belong to and feel accepted by your group. This I
imagine is one of the root causes of his desire to be more Dutch and less
Chinese. And now that he reconciled with his past, it seemed that he accepted
being Chinese on the outside and Dutch on the inside, just like a banana. But
does this mean he feels being Dutch, Chinese or both, Chinese-Dutch?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>[6.5/10] Matt Parker's Humble Pi</title><link>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/1_humble_pi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.robert-sokolewicz.nl/books/1_humble_pi/</guid><description>Matt Parker some of us know from his appearances on the YouTube channel numberphile and on his personal YouTube channel standupmaths.

Matt created a collection of funny situations and unexpected mistakes in the real world, that originate from math mistakes. It is a fun read to spend a few evenings, but unfortunately for me most of the problems I already knew.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The oldest known maths error was found on an old Sumerian clay tablet that was made between 3000 and 3400 BC. Someone named Kushim was in charge of tracking stock levels in a warehouse containing ingredients to make beer. There are 18 tablets signed by Kushim that involves counting how much barley there is, and in one of the tablets he made a mistake of adding things up.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In 2011 the book &lt;em>the making of a fly&lt;/em> was for sale on Amazon for over 23 million USD. There were two sellers selling the book, and apparently their listing price was determined automatically using an algorithm. One seller set their price to be for example 1.5% higher then the second lowest price, while the second seller set the price to be 0.9% cheaper then the second lowest price. As time went on, the algorithms were increasing the price bit by bit until it was noticed that the listing price increased from about 10 USD to 23 USD.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In 1983, Air Canada flight 143 ran out of fuel mid flight because the ground crew used pounds instead of kilograms to measure the total amount of fuel. After safely landing and refuelling&amp;hellip; the exact same thing happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In 1968 after the space shuttle Challenger exploded, a special commission was formed to investigate the root cause. One of the commission members was Richard Feynman, and it was discovered that the rubber rings that connected different sections of the booster rockets did not produce a tight seal. This was in part of lack of elasticity in low temperatures (and the shuttle was launched on a particularly cold day), but also because the booster rocket sections were not perfectly circular. The way the engineers determined how circular each section was, was by measuring the diameter across three angles and ensure that they are equal. However, a circle isn&amp;rsquo;t the only shape with constant diameter, and hence the approach of the engineers failed. Consider for example the Reuleaux triangle which has a constant diameter across all angles:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
