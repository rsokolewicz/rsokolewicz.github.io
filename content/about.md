Experienced software developer, data scientist, & researcher who is excellent in analytical and numerical modeling, programming and data analysis, and is initiative-taking and self-managed. In my spare time I enjoy watching mathematics lectures on YouTube, building an android app to classify mushrooms, designing quantum circuits/algorithms, web-scraping, competing on Kaggle.com, skateboarding, bouldering and brewing beer.
