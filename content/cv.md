Experienced software developer, data scientist, & researcher who is excellent in analytical and numerical modeling, programming and data analysis, and is initiative-taking and self-managed. In my spare time I enjoy watching mathematics lectures on YouTube, building an android app to classify mushrooms, designing quantum circuits/algorithms, web-scraping, competing on Kaggle.com, skateboarding, bouldering and brewing beer. 

# Work Experience
##### Data scientist & XR Developer, Centre for Innovation, jan 2021 - present
Working on projects relating to the broad theme of Data and AI that ranges from improving the university's education to providing solutions in the humanitarian, peace and justice sectors. All software that we create is open source, version controlled, documented and contain unit-tests to ensure stability and maintainability.

##### Humanitarian data science volunteer, 510 Global -- Red Cross, jun 2020 - dec 2020
I shared my knowledge and expertise on various machine learning algorithms that can be used to improve crisis mitigation in African countries.

##### Postdoc, Theory of Condensed Matter -- Radboud University, jun 2020 - nov 2020 
I investigated magnetic and electronic properties of novel two-dimensional materials. This research could lead to the development of smaller, faster and more energy efficient (greener) computer chips and memory.

##### PhD candidate, Theory of Condensed Matter -- Radboud University, jun 2016 - may 2020
I investigated magnetic and electronic properties of novel two-dimensional materials. This research could lead to the development of smaller, faster and more energy efficient (greener) computer chips and memory.
