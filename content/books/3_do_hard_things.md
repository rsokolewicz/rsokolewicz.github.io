## summary
"Do Hard Things" explores the misconceptions surrounding toughness.
Using anecdotes from his experience in running together with the latest
scientific results, Steve Magness teaches us how to "cultivate real toughness".
Right away Steve dismisses the conventional wisdom that harsh coaching and tough
parenting characterized by verbal and physical abuse, produces real toughness.
More often than not, such approaches act as filters rather than effective
training methods {{< cite "jackson1998authoritative;rankin2009impact;darling2017parenting;tough_love;baumrind1991influence" >}}. 

The book explores many psychological factors that play a role in athletic
performance. Self-esteem for example is not driven by rewards and punishment but
is derived from personal growth. The *fake it till you make it* mentality is
also something that is proven to not work. It works in the short term in
low-challenge situations but is completely ineffective in more demanding
situations {{< cite "fakeit" >}}. Similarly, overconfidence is also shown to be detrimental. 
True self-esteem and true confidence are the product of
self-awareness: being true to yourself and the ability to choose appropriate
goals to maintain motivation and overcome obstacles. Confidence and esteem,
then, come from effectively utilizing one's capabilities, rather than relying on
superficial beliefs.

Emotions and feelings are discussed as valuable indicators of one's health and
state of mind. The book explains how naming and understanding these emotions can
provide a sense of control and aid in problem-solving. It highlights the
benefits of utilizing anxiety and pressure as motivators, rather than allowing
them to hinder progress {{< cite "strack2017must" >}}.

Furthermore, it explores how developing equanimity, the ability to respond
rather than react, is crucial in developing toughness {{< cite "kral2018impact;kakigi2005intracerebral" >}}. Similar to mindfulness,
stoicism, and yoga, equanimity is not about suppression of feelings or
indifference, but rather about a balanced approach to experience, meaning that
one does not fall into emotional extremes because of worldly winds such as
praise and blame, success and failure, pleasure and pain. 

This is somewhat in contrast to cognitive narrowing, where one's focus and
attention become too concentrated at the expense of other stimuli in the
environment. Not only does this have negative effects on rumination, and
decision-making, but it can also lead to depression. 

In essence, we are encouraged to embrace challenges, seek personal growth, and
develop resilience through self-awareness, autonomy, and a sense of purpose. By
adopting these principles, individuals can navigate difficulties and develop
"real toughness".

## thoughts
The book contains a nice balance between light-weight anecdotes and
the more heavy descriptions of psychological experiments and scientific facts.
The content seems well-researched and established and it seems that Steve knows
what he talks about. The book was not quite what I expected it to be. I expected
more about physical training, diets and overall the effect on the body and mind
of *doing hard things*. As mentioned in the summary, the book leans heavily on
mental health. It is somewhat surprising that a healthy and strong mind is a
necessity for top-performing athletes, though it does remind me of e.g. what Andre
Agassi wrote in his biography *Open*: that he lost important matches because
his head wasn't in the right place.

Steve proposes several "pillars" that need to be built to cultivate toughness.
Most of these pillars are mantras, or advice to achieve a sort of mental
calmness. These pillars can be found in many self-help books, so most of it was not
new to me, but it was a nice refresher in the new context of high-performance
athletics. The last pillar, for example, to find meaning in discomfort comes from
Viktor Frankl's book Man's Search for Meaning. 

## some interesting facts
- There's a condition that is sometimes called "give up itis" {{< cite "leach2018give" >}}, the phenomenon often described as a sensation of
  listlessness, extreme apathy and hopelessness where an individual loses the
  will to live and dies, even if there is nothing physically wrong with them.
  Steve gives an example from one of the first settlements in the Americas,
  Jamestown, where a large portion of the population died due to "apathy,
  idleness and laziness". In the first year, only 38 out of the 108 original
  settlers survived, and in the next decade, the odds of survival did not
  improve much. That is, until James Smith arrived and created the rule that
  every man must work on the farms for four hours a day, under the new motto
  "work or starve". As explained by John Leach, *"That sensation of choice
  indicates a reversal of mental defeat and the reimposition of some personal
  control over the situation which is a key factor in recovery. . . .
  (Give-up-itis) is the clinical expression of mental defeat; in particular, it
  is a pathology of a normal, passive coping response."*. This is also explained
  by Peter Bourne {{< cite "bourne196817" >}} who analyzed the cortisol levels
  of soldiers before and after stressful combat situations. As he explains it
  *"Our level of control changes how we respond to stress."*

- The self-esteem movement in the US, e.g. getting trophies and awards for
everything, was strongly influenced by the politician John Vasconcellos. He
envisioned that a lack of self-esteem is the biggest contributor to many
pressing problems in the USA: drugs, crime, depression, poverty and family
problems. He argued that if every US citizen would feel worthy and valuable then
they could all reach their full potential and all the problems mentioned above
would naturally disappear. He assigned a sociologist, Neil Smelser, to head a
task force tasked with investigating the impact of self-esteem {{< cite "mecca1990california" >}}. After a
preliminary report by Smelser, Vasconcellos was convinced: *“Self-esteem is the
likeliest candidate for a social vaccine, something that empowers us to live
responsibly and that inoculates us against the lures of crime, violence,
substance abuse, teen pregnancy, child abuse, chronic welfare dependency, and
educational failure.”*. Unfortunately, Vasconcellos was all wrong and he based
this conclusion not on the actual outcomes of Smelser's main conclusions but on
a small unrelated segment of his research. Nonetheless, Vasconcellos managed to
convince politicians, the media and the public that raising self-esteem was an
absolute must. Soon after, school programs and promotional campaigns were set up
to ensure every American individual would be steaming with self-esteem.
Unfortunately, this only works if self-esteem comes from within, not
through external factors, and by doing actual hard work.
