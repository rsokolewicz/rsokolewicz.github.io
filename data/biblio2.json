    "abstract": "The understanding of the structural and thermal properties of membranes, low-dimensional flexible systems in a space of higher dimension, is pursued in many fields from string theory to chemistry and biology. The case of a two-dimensional (2D) membrane in three dimensions is the relevant one for dealing with real materials. Traditionally, membranes are primarily discussed in the context of biological membranes and soft matter in general. The complexity of these systems hindered a realistic description of their interatomic structures based on a truly microscopic approach. Therefore, theories of membranes were developed mostly within phenomenological models. From the point of view of statistical mechanics, membranes at finite temperature are systems governed by interacting long-range fluctuations.Graphene, the first truly two-dimensional system consisting of just one layer of carbon atoms, provides a model system for the development of a microscopic description of membranes. In the same way that geneticists have used Drosophila as a gateway to probe more complex questions, theoretical chemists and physicists can use graphene as a simple model membrane to study both phenomenological theories and experiments. In this Account, we review key results in the microscopic theory of structural and thermal properties of graphene and compare them with the predictions of phenomenological theories. The two approaches are in good agreement for the various scaling properties of correlation functions of atomic displacements. However, some other properties, such as the temperature dependence of the bending rigidity, cannot be understood based on phenomenological approaches. We also consider graphene at very high temperature and compare the results with existing models for two-dimensional melting. The melting of graphene presents a different scenario, and we describe that process as the decomposition of the graphene layer into entangled carbon chains.",

    "abstract": "Carbon is one of the most intriguing elements in the Periodic Table. It forms many allotropes, some known from ancient times (diamond and graphite) and some discovered 10-20 years ago (fullerenes and nanotubes). Interestingly, the two-dimensional form (graphene) was only obtained very recently, immediately attracting a great deal of attention. Electrons in graphene, obeying a linear dispersion relation, behave like massless relativistic particles. This results in the observation of a number of very peculiar electronic properties – from an anomalous quantum Hall effect to the absence of localization – in this, the first two-dimensional material. It also provides a bridge between condensed matter physics and quantum electrodynamics, and opens new perspectives for carbon-based electronics.",

    "abstract": "Single- or multi-layer transition metal oxides (TMOs) have a relatively longer history than other atomically thin materials. TMOs comprise many earth-abundant minerals and have been used for millenia as construction materials, pigments, lubricants, for heat management and many other applications. In TMOs, the transition metal s electrons are strongly pulled by oxygen, and consequently the structural, physical and chemical properties are mostly determined by the strongly correlated d electrons. TMOs are also highly tunable owing to the diversity of their chemical composition, crystal structure and relative ease in inducing oxygen defects. Two dimensional (2D) TMOs often show different physical and chemical properties in comparison to their bulk counterparts. These differences give rise to a variety of remarkable electronic properties such as high temperature superconductivity and multiferroicity and also unique optical, mechanical and thermal phenomena. Additionally, reducing the thickness of TMOs can alter their catalytic and chemical characteristics. Despite their unique properties, single- and few-layer TMOs have received relatively little attention compared to other recent families of atomically thin materials such as layered transition metal dichalcogenides. The overarching aim of this review is to bring the unique aspects of TMOs to the attention of the research community to establish a strong future for research on 2D and layered TMOs. In this review, a comprehensive overview regarding 2D and layered TMOs will be presented. The fundamentals and applications of planar TMOs are discussed. The manuscript will also present future prospects and pathways to new developments that are offered by such TMOs.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant interest because of their large surface-to-volume ratios and electron confinement. Compared to common 2D materials such as graphene or metal hydroxides, with their intrinsic layered atomic structures, the formation mechanisms of 2D metal oxides with a rocksalt structure are not well understood. Here, we report the formation process for 2D cobalt oxide and cobalt nickel oxide nanosheets, after analysis by in situ liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal that three-dimensional (3D) nanoparticles are initially formed from the molecular precursor solution and then transform into 2D nanosheets. Ab initio calculations show that a small nanocrystal is dominated by positive edge energy, but when it grows to a certain size, the negative surface energy becomes dominant, driving the transformation of the 3D nanocrystal into a 2D structure. Uncovering these growth pathways, including the 3D-to-2D transition, provides opportunities for future material design and synthesis in solution.",

    "abstract": "Na2Co2TeO6 has recently been proposed to be a Kitaev-like honeycomb magnet. To assess how close it is to realizing Kitaev quantum spin liquids, we have measured magnetization and specific heat on high-quality single crystals in magnetic fields applied along high-symmetry directions. Small training fields reveal a weak but canonical ferrimagnetic behavior below 27 K, which suggests that the previously established zigzag antiferromagnetic order, with collinear moments pointing along the zigzag chains, must be supplemented by q=0 (e.g., Néel type in the absence of structural modulations) moment canting. Moderate fields in the honeycomb plane suppress the thermal transition at 27 K, and seem to partly reverse the moment canting when applied perpendicular to the zigzag chains. In contrast, out-of-plane fields leave the transition largely unaffected, but promotes another transition below 10 K, possibly also related to canting reversal. The magnetism in Na2Co2TeO6 is highly anisotropic and close to tipping points between competing phases.",

    "abstract": "We report that two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheets have been successfully synthesized using the electrolysis of nickel plate as the anode in deionized water. The electrolysis processes first produced 2D nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) nanosheets, which were transformed to 2D NiO by calcination. Contrary to the classical crystallization mechanism, contiguous SEM observations revealed that the Ni(OH)2 were produced via a multistep oriented attachment (MOA) mode, in which the [Ni(OH)6]4- coordination octahedron serves as the building block. Hydrothermal experiments further showed that the technique can be applied to the synthesis of 3D Ni(OH)2 nanoflowers with the aid of introduced Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. A growth mechanism based on the selective-surface adsorption and intercalation of nitrate ions (NO3-) and hydroxyl ions (OH-) as well as the adsorption of free ammonia molecules (NH3), was proposed. The crystal morphologies and thickness can be controlled by a charging magnetic field, suggesting that the crystal growth mechanisms are dominated by micromechanics such as the magnetic dipole force, Van der Waals force and magnetic force.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric (FE) materials displaying spontaneous polarizations are promising candidates for miniaturized electronic and memory devices. However, stable FE orderings are only found in a small number of 2D materials by experiment so far. In the current work, based on high-throughput screening of a 2D van der Waals layered materials database and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate niobium oxide dihalides NbOX2 (X = Cl, Br and I), a group of experimentally synthesized yet underexplored van der Waals layered compounds, as a new family of 2D materials that simultaneously exhibit intrinsic in-plane ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity. Similar to FE perovskite oxides, polar displacement of Nb cations relative to the center of the anion octahedral cage can lead to experimentally measurable FE polarizations up to 27 \\muC cm-2 in layered NbOX2. The presence of low-lying antiferroelectric (AFE) phases can effectively reduce the energy barrier associated with polarization switching, suggesting switchable ferroelectricity is experimentally achievable. In addition, the mechanism driving FE phase transitions in NbOX2 monolayers around Curie temperature TC is clearly revealed by our finite-temperature simulations. NbOCl2 monolayer is predicted to be a stable ferroelectric with TC above room temperature. Moreover, application of NbOBr2 and NbOI2 monolayers as 2D dielectric capacitors is further developed, where electrostatic energy storage of nearly 100",

    "abstract": "Due to their layered structure, two-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites (RPPs), composed of multiple organic/inorganic quantum wells, can in principle be exfoliated down to few and single layers. These molecularly thin layers are expected to present unique properties with respect to the bulk counterpart, due to increased lattice deformations caused by interface strain. Here, we have synthesized centimetre-sized, pure-phase single-crystal RPP perovskites (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n-1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–4) from which single quantum well layers have been exfoliated. We observed a reversible shift in excitonic energies induced by laser annealing on exfoliated layers encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride. Moreover, a highly efficient photodetector was fabricated using a molecularly thin n = 4 RPP crystal, showing a photogain of 105 and an internal quantum efficiency of ~34%. Our results suggest that, thanks to their dynamic structure, atomically thin perovskites enable an additional degree of control for the bandgap engineering of these materials",

    "abstract": "The unique hybrid nature of 2D Ruddlesden–Popper (R–P) perovskites has bestowed upon them not only tunability of their electronic properties but also high-performance electronic devices with improved environmental stability as compared to their 3D analogs. However, there is limited information about their inherent heat, light, and air stability and how different parameters such as the inorganic layer number and length of organic spacer molecule affect stability. To gain deeper understanding on the matter we have expanded the family of 2D R–P perovskites, by utilizing pentylamine (PA)2(MA)n-1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–5, PA = CH3(CH2)4NH3+, C5) and hexylamine (HA)2(MA)n-1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–4, HA = CH3(CH2)5NH3+, C6) as the organic spacer molecules between the inorganic slabs, creating two new series of layered materials, for up to n = 5 and 4 layers, respectively. The resulting compounds were extensively characterized through a combination of physical and spectroscopic methods, including single crystal X-ray analysis. High resolution powder X-ray diffraction studies using synchrotron radiation shed light for the first time to the phase transitions of the higher layer 2D R–P perovskites. The increase in the length of the organic spacer molecules did not affect their optical properties; however, it has a pronounced effect on the air, heat, and light stability of the fabricated thin films. An extensive study of heat, light, and air stability with and without encapsulation revealed that specific compounds can be air stable (relative humidity (RH) = 20–80% \\pm 5%) for more than 450 days, while heat and light stability in air can be exponentially increased by encapsulating the corresponding films. Evaluation of the out-of-plane mechanical properties of the corresponding materials showed that their soft and flexible nature can be compared to current commercially available polymer substrates (e.g., PMMA), rendering them suitable for fabricating flexible and wearable electronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the discovery of two-dimensional transition-metal materials with non-trivial magnetic and electronic properties has spurred huge interest in investigating their applications in nanotechnology. Here, we report that the monolayer of CoBr3 possesses a quantum anomalous Hall insulating phase generated on the basis of first-principles calculations. We find that the CoBr3 monolayer is an intrinsic two-dimensional ferromagnetic material with a Curie temperature Tc = 264 K predicted from Monte Carlo simulations. The phonon spectra analysis indicates that the CoBr3 monolayer is dynamically stable. Taking into account spin–orbit coupling, this makes the electronic structure of the CoBr3 monolayer topologically non-trivial with a global band gap of 8.7 meV. The anomalous Hall conductivity calculation shows a Chern number C = 2, meaning the presence of a two edge state in nanoribbons of finite width. These findings not only add an experimentally feasible member to the quantum anomalous Hall insulator family, but also pave the way for highly promising application potentials in nanoelectronics and spintronics.",

    "abstract": "The successful isolation of graphene ten years ago has evoked a rapidly growing scientific interest in the nature of two-dimensional (2D) crystals. A number of different 2D crystals has been produced since then, with properties ranging from superconductivity to insulating behavior. Here, we predict the possibility for realizing ferromagnetic 2D crystals by exfoliating atomically thin films of K2CuF4. From a first-principles theoretical analysis, we find that single layers of K2CuF4 form exactly 2D Kosterlitz-Thouless systems. The 2D crystal can form a free-standing membrane, and exhibits an experimentally accessible transition temperature and robust magnetic moments of 1\\muB per formula unit. 2D K2CuF4 unites ferromagnetic and insulating properties and is a demonstration of principles for nanoelectronics such as novel 2D-based heterostructures.",

    "abstract": "Control of magnetism by applied voltage is desirable for spintronics applications. Finding a suitable material remains an elusive goal, with only a few candidates found so far. Graphene is one of them and attracts interest because of its weak spin–orbit interaction, the ability to control electronic properties by the electric field effect and the possibility to introduce paramagnetic centres such as vacancies and adatoms. Here we show that the magnetism of adatoms in graphene is itinerant and can be controlled by doping, so that magnetic moments are switched on and off. The much-discussed vacancy magnetism is found to have a dual origin, with two approximately equal contributions; one from itinerant magnetism and the other from dangling bonds. Our work suggests that graphene’s spin transport can be controlled by the field effect, similar to its electronic and optical properties, and that spin diffusion can be significantly enhanced above a certain carrier density.",

Chemisorption energy as a function of hydrogen concentration is calculated, as well as energy barriers for hydrogen binding and release. The results confirm that graphene can be perspective material for hydrogen storage. Difference between hydrogenation of graphene, nanotubes, and bulk graphite is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by recent experimental data (Sepioni, M.; et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2010, 105, 207-205), we have studied the possibility of forming magnetic clusters with spin S > 1/2 on graphene by adsorption of hydrogen atoms or hydroxyl groups. Migration of hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl groups on the surface of graphene during the delamination of HOPG led to the formation of seven atom or seven OH-group clusters with S = 5/2 that were of a special interest. The coincidence of symmetry of the clusters with the graphene lattice strengthens the stability of the cluster. For (OH)7 clusters that were situated greater than 3 nm from one another, the reconstruction barrier to a nonmagnetic configuration was approximately 0.4 eV, whereas for H7 clusters, there was no barrier and the high-spin state was unstable. Stability of the high-spin clusters increased if they were formed on top of ripples. Exchange interactions between the clusters were studied and we have shown that the ferromagnetic state is improbable. The role of the chemical composition of the solvent used for the delamination of graphite is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry1,2,3. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter4,5, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon6,7) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac’s (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective “speed of light” c* \\approx 106 m s-1. Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene’s conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass mc of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = mcc*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.",

    "abstract": "Spin electronics is a rapidly expanding field stimulated by a strong synergy between breakthrough basic research discoveries and industrial applications in the fields of magnetic recording, magnetic field sensors, nonvolatile memories [magnetic random access memories (MRAM) and especially spin-transfer-torque MRAM (STT-MRAM)]. In addition to the discovery of several physical phenomena (giant magnetoresistance, tunnel magnetoresistance, spin-transfer torque, spin-orbit torque, spin Hall effect, spin Seebeck effect, etc.), outstanding progress has been made on the growth and nanopatterning of magnetic multilayered films and nanostructures in which these phenomena are observed. Magnetic anisotropy is usually observed in materials that have large spin-orbit interactions. However, in 2002 perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) was discovered to exist at magnetic metal/oxide interfaces [for instance Co(Fe)/alumina]. Surprisingly, this PMA is observed in systems where spin-orbit interactions are quite weak, but its amplitude is remarkably large—comparable to that measured at Co/Pt interfaces, a reference for large interfacial anisotropy (anisotropy\\sim1.4 erg/cm2=1.4 mJ/m2). Actually, this PMA was found to be very common at magnetic metal/oxide interfaces since it has been observed with a large variety of amorphous or crystalline oxides, including AlOx, MgO, TaOx, HfOx, etc. This PMA is thought to be the result of electronic hybridization between the oxygen and the magnetic transition metal orbit across the interface, a hypothesis supported by ab initio calculations. Interest in this phenomenon was sparked in 2010 when it was demonstrated that the PMA at magnetic transition metal/oxide interfaces could be used to build out-of-plane magnetized magnetic tunnel junctions for STT-MRAM cells. In these systems, the PMA at the CoFeB/MgO interface can be used to simultaneously obtain good memory retention, thanks to the large PMA amplitude, and a low write current, thanks to a relatively weak Gilbert damping. These two requirements for memories tend to be difficult to reconcile since they rely on the same spin-orbit coupling. PMA-based approaches have now become ubiquitous in the designs for perpendicular STT-MRAM, and major microelectronics companies are actively working on their development with the first goal of addressing embedded FLASH and static random access memory-type of applications. Scalability of STT-MRAM devices based on this interfacial PMA is expected to soon exceed the 20-nm nodes. Several very active new fields of research also rely on interfacial PMA at magnetic metal/oxide interfaces, including spin-orbit torques associated with Rashba or spin Hall effects, record high speed domain wall propagation in buffer/magnetic metal/oxide-based magnetic wires, and voltage-based control of anisotropy. This review deals with PMA at magnetic metal/oxide interfaces from its discovery, by examining the diversity of systems in which it has been observed and the physicochemical methods through which the key roles played by the electronic hybridization at the metal/oxide interface were elucidated. The physical origins of the phenomenon are also covered and how these are supported by ab initio calculations is dealt with. Finally, some examples of applications of this interfacial PMA in STT-MRAM are listed along with the various emerging research topics taking advantage of this PMA.",

    "abstract": "We use microscopic linear response theory to derive a set of equations that provide a complete description of coupled spin and charge diffusive transport in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with the Rashba spin-orbit (SO) interaction. These equations capture a number of interrelated effects including spin accumulation and diffusion, Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation, magnetoelectric, and spin-galvanic effects. They can be used under very general circumstances to model transport experiments in 2DEG systems that involve either electrical or optical spin injection. We comment on the relationship between these equations and the exact spin and charge density operator equations of motion. As an example of the application of our equations, we consider a simple electrical spin injection experiment and show that a voltage will develop between two ferromagnetic contacts if a spin-polarized current is injected into a 2DEG, that depends on the relative magnetization orientation of the contacts. This voltage is present even when the separation between the contacts is larger than the spin diffusion length.",

    "abstract": "This chapter is concerned with spin-resonance absorption—that is, power absorption from an oscillating magnetic field—by conduction electrons. The e place of spin resonance in investigations of the band structure contrasts the cases of paramagnetic salts and conductors. In the former, the levels of the ions are discrete; when they have an odd number of electrons each level is at least twofold degenerate. An external magnetic field splits this degeneracy. The microwave spectroscopy of the energy bands is not confined to spin resonance, but includes cyclotron resonance. Of the two, undoubtedly the latter provides the most direct information on the energy bands. Spin resonance does not play the central role that it does in paramagnetic salts. However, it usually plays a useful supplementary role when something about the band structure is known, serving either as a check on the band model or determining the values of additional parameters. The use of spin resonance in semiconductors and semimetals grow as better materials are made and detailed knowledge about their band structure becomes available.",

Particular attention is given to the bands in impurity semiconductors with diamond-type structure. g-values are calculated for electron states typical of various possible cases and it is found that different values are obtained according as to whether the Fermi level is near or distant from a band degeneracy. The spin-lattice relaxation time is calculated so that the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the wave functions is included, and times in fair agreement with those observed in silicon and alkali metals are obtained.",

    "abstract": "We investigate how spins relax in intrinsic graphene. The spin-orbit coupling arises from the band structure and is enhanced by ripples. The orbital motion is influenced by scattering centers and ripple-induced gauge fields. Spin relaxation due to Elliot-Yafet and Dyakonov-Perel mechanisms and gauge fields in combination with spin-orbit coupling are discussed. In intrinsic graphene, the Dyakonov-Perel mechanism and spin flip due to gauge fields dominate and the spin-flip relaxation time is inversely proportional to the elastic scattering time. The spin-relaxation anisotropy depends on an intricate competition between these mechanisms. Experimental consequences are discussed.",

In both cases the ground state is unique. The second theorem confirms an old, unproved conjecture in the \\parallelB\\parallel=\\parallelA\\parallel case and yields, with \\parallelB\\parallel\\neq\\parallelA\\parallel, the first provable example of itinerant-electron ferromagnetism. The theorems hold in all dimensions without even the necessity of a periodic lattice structure.",

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials holds promises for spintronic devices with exceptional properties. However, to use 2D vdW magnets for building spintronic nanodevices such as magnetic memories, key challenges remain in terms of effectively switching the magnetization from one state to the other electrically. Here, we devise a bilayer structure of Fe3GeTe2/Pt, in which the magnetization of few-layered Fe3GeTe2 can be effectively switched by the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) originated from the current flowing in the Pt layer. The effective magnetic fields corresponding to the SOTs are further quantitatively characterized using harmonic measurements. Our demonstration of the SOT-driven magnetization switching in a 2D vdW magnet could pave the way for implementing low-dimensional materials in the next-generation spintronic applications. Spin-orbit torque flips the perpendicular magnetic moment of a 2D van der Waals magnet. Spin-orbit torque flips the perpendicular magnetic moment of a 2D van der Waals magnet.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that the spin Hall effect in a thin film with strong spin-orbit scattering can excite magnetic precession in an adjacent ferromagnetic film. The flow of alternating current through a Pt/NiFe bilayer generates an oscillating transverse spin current in the Pt, and the resultant transfer of spin angular momentum to the NiFe induces ferromagnetic resonance dynamics. The Oersted field from the current also generates a ferromagnetic resonance signal but with a different symmetry. The ratio of these two signals allows a quantitative determination of the spin current and the spin Hall angle.",

    "abstract": "Spintronics in ferromagnetic metals is built on a complementary set of phenomena in which magnetic configurations influence transport coefficients and transport currents alter magnetic configurations. Here, we propose that corresponding effects occur in circuits containing antiferromagnetic metals. The critical current for order parameter orientation switching can be smaller in the antiferromagnetic case because of the absence of shape anisotropy and because spin torques can act through the entire volume of an antiferromagnet. We discuss possible applications of antiferromagnetic metal spintronics.",

It is shown that the “weak” ferromagnetism is due to the relativistic spin-lattice and the magnetic dipole interactions. A strong dependence of the properties of “weak” ferromagnetics on the magnetic crystalline symmetry is noted and the behaviour of these ferromagnetics in a magnetic field is studied.",

    "abstract": "A theory of anisotropic superexchange interaction is developed by extending the Anderson theory of superexchange to include spin-orbit coupling. The antisymmetric spin coupling suggested by Dzialoshinski from purely symmetry grounds and the symmetric pseudodipolar interaction are derived. Their orders of magnitudes are estimated to be (\\Deltagg) and (\\Deltagg)2 times the isotropic superexchange energy, respectively. Higher order spin couplings are also discussed. As an example of antisymmetric spin coupling the case of CuCl2\\cdot2H2O is illustrated. In CuCl2\\cdot2H2O, a spin arrangement which is different from one accepted so far is proposed. This antisymmetric interaction is shown to be responsible for weak ferromagnetism in \\alpha-Fe2O3, MnCO3, and CrF3. The paramagnetic susceptibility perpendicular to the trigonal axis is expected to increase very sharply near the Néel temperature as the temperature is lowered, as was actually observed in CrF3.",

    "abstract": "We consider a contribution wch to the micromagnetic energy density that is linear with respect to the first spatial derivatives of the local magnetization direction. For a generalized two-dimensional Rashba ferromagnet, we present a microscopic analysis of this contribution and, in particular, demonstrate that it cannot be expressed through Lifshitz invariants beyond the linear order in the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. Terms in wch beyond Lifshitz invariants emerge as a result of spin rotation symmetry breaking caused by SOC. The effects of these terms on the phase diagram of magnetic states and spin-wave dispersion are discussed. Finally, we present a classification of terms in wch, allowed by symmetry, for each crystallographic point group.",

    "abstract": "Efficient and stable algorithms for the calculation of spectral quantities and correlation functions are some of the key tools in computational condensed-matter physics. In this paper basic properties and recent developments of Chebyshev expansion based algorithms and the kernel polynomial method are reviewed. Characterized by a resource consumption that scales linearly with the problem dimension these methods enjoyed growing popularity over the last decade and found broad application not only in physics. Representative examples from the fields of disordered systems, strongly correlated electrons, electron-phonon interaction, and quantum spin systems are discussed in detail. In addition, an illustration on how the kernel polynomial method is successfully embedded into other numerical techniques, such as cluster perturbation theory or Monte Carlo simulation, is provided.",

    "abstract": "The oxide superconductors, particularly those recently discovered that are based on La2CuO4, have a set of peculiarities that suggest a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought \"resonating-valence-bond\" state or \"quantum spin liquid\" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.",

    "abstract": "The electrical resistivity of Fe-Cr-Fe layers with antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange increases when the magnetizations of the Fe layers are aligned antiparallel. The effect is much stronger than the usual anisotropic magnetoresistance and further increases in structures with more than two Fe layers. It can be explained in terms of spin-flip scattering of conduction electrons caused by the antiparallel alignment of the magnetization.",

    "abstract": "Using electrical characteristics from three-terminal field-effect transistors (FETs), we demonstrate substantial strain induced band gap tunability in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in line with theoretical predictions and optical experiments. Devices were fabricated on flexible substrates, and a cantilever sample holder was used to apply uniaxial tensile strain to the various multilayer TMD FETs. Analyzing in particular transfer characteristics, we argue that the modified device characteristics under strain are clear evidence of a band gap reduction of 100 meV in WSe2 under 1.35% uniaxial tensile strain at room temperature. Furthermore, the obtained device characteristics imply that the band gap does not shrink uniformly under strain relative to a reference potential defined by the source/drain contacts. Instead, the band gap change is only related to a change of the conduction band edge of WSe2, resulting in a decrease in the Schottky barrier (SB) for electrons without any change for hole injection into the valence band. Simulations of SB device characteristics are employed to explain this point and to quantify our findings. Last, our experimental results are compared with DFT calculations under strain showing excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and the experimental data presented here.",

    "abstract": "We present a density functional theory study of the carrier-density and strain dependence of magnetic order in two-dimensional (2D) MAX3(M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; A = Si, Ge, Sn; and X = S, Se, Te) transition metal trichalcogenides. Our ab initio calculations show that this class of compounds includes wide and narrow gap semiconductors, metals, and half-metals, and that most of these compounds are magnetic. Although antiferromagnetic order is most common, ferromagnetism is predicted in MSiSe3 for M = Mn and Ni; in MSiTe3 for M = V and Ni; in MnGeSe3; MGeTe3 for M = Cr, Mn, and Ni; in FeSnS3; and in MSnTe3 for M = V, Mn, and Fe. Among these compounds CrGeTe3,VSnTe3, and CrSnTe3 are ferromagnetic semiconductors. Our calculations suggest that the competition between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic order can be substantially altered by strain engineering, and in the semiconductor case also by gating. The associated critical temperatures can be enhanced by means of carrier doping and strains.",

    "abstract": "The search for topologically non-trivial states of matter has become an important goal for condensed matter physics. Recently, a new class of topological insulators has been proposed. These topological insulators have an insulating gap in the bulk, but have topologically protected edge states due to the time reversal symmetry. In two dimensions the helical edge states give rise to the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, in the absence of any external magnetic field. Here we review a recent theory which predicts that the QSH state can be realized in HgTe/CdTe semiconductor quantum wells (QWs). By varying the thickness of the QW, the band structure changes from a normal to an “inverted” type at a critical thickness d c . We present an analytical solution of the helical edge states and explicitly demonstrate their topological stability. We also review the recent experimental observation of the QSH state in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te QWs. We review both the fabrication of the sample and the experimental setup. For thin QWs with well width d QW <6.3 nm, the insulating regime shows the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker QWs ( d QW >6.3 nm), the nominally insulating regime shows a plateau of residual conductance close to 2 e 2 / h . The residual conductance is independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance is destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d c =6.3 nm, is also independently determined from the occurrence of a magnetic field induced insulator to metal transition.",

    "abstract": "Charge-spin conversion (CSC) is a process to convert electrical signal to spin signal and vice versa, which is fundamentally the interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedoms of electron. In modern spintronics, CSC is widely used to control the novel properties of materials and generate new functionalities of devices, due to the fact that the electrical operation is still the most efficient method to control various spintronic devices and compatible with modern technologies of electronics. The efficiency of CSC is in principle determined by the material property and the device structure; therefore tremendous efforts are put to explore new materials and new architectures. The 2D systems can serve as ideal material platforms to generate high-speed, high-density, and low-cost spintronic devices, due to their exotic spin properties. The CSC effect in 2D systems has been becoming one of the most emerging research fields of spintronics.",

    "abstract": "Fluorinated graphene, an up-rising member of the graphene family, combines a two-dimensional layer-structure, a wide bandgap, and high stability and attracts significant attention because of its unique nanostructure and carbon–fluorine bonds. Here, we give an extensive review of recent progress on synthetic methods and C–F bonding; additionally, we present the optical, electrical and electronic properties of fluorinated graphene and its electrochemical/biological applications. Fluorinated graphene exhibits various types of C–F bonds (covalent, semi-ionic, and ionic bonds), tunable F/C ratios, and different configurations controlled by synthetic methods including direct fluorination and exfoliation methods. The relationship between the types/amounts of C–F bonds and specific properties, such as opened bandgap, high thermal and chemical stability, dispersibility, semiconducting/insulating nature, magnetic, self-lubricating and mechanical properties and thermal conductivity, is discussed comprehensively. By optimizing the C–F bonding character and F/C ratios, fluorinated graphene can be utilized for energy conversion and storage devices, bioapplications, electrochemical sensors and amphiphobicity. Based on current progress, we propose potential problems of fluorinated graphene as well as the future challenge on the synthetic methods and C-F bonding character. This review will provide guidance for controlling C–F bonds, developing fluorine-related effects and promoting the application of fluorinated graphene.",

    "abstract": "Two dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (2D-hBN), an isomorph of graphene with a very similar layered structure, is uniquely featured by its exotic opto-electrical properties together with mechanical robustness, thermal stability, and chemical inertness. It is thus extensively studied for application in field effect transistors (FETs), tunneling devices, deep UV emitters and detectors, photoelectric devices, and nanofillers. 2D-hBN is considered as one of the most promising materials that can be integrated with other 2D materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), for the next generation microelectronic and other technologies. Although it is by itself an insulator, it can well be tuned by several strategies in terms of properties and functionalities, such as by doping, substitution, functionalization and hybridization, making 2D-hBN a truly versatile type of functional materials for a wide range of applications. In this review, the distinct structural characteristics of 2D-hBN, doping- and defect-induced variations in energy bands and structures, and resultant properties, are presented. There are a wide variety of processing routes that have been developed for 2D-hBN, including also those for doping, substitution, functionalization and combination with other materials to form heterostructures or h-BNC hybrid nanosheets, which are systematically elaborated for novel functions. The comprehensive overview provides the types of the state-of-the-art 2D-hBN made by new synthesis strategies, where the mainstream approaches include exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, and gas phase epitaxy, together with several other new methods that have been successfully developed in the past few years. On the basis of the extraordinary electrical and functional properties and thermal–mechanical stability, the applications of hBN-based nanosheets as substrates and dielectrics, passivation layers, and nanofillers in nanodevices and nanocomposites are discussed, together with the peculiar optical and wetting characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The search for symmetry-protected two-dimensional (2D) Dirac semimetals analogous to graphene is important both for fundamental and practical interest. The 2D Dirac cones are protected by crystalline symmetries and magnetic ordering may destroy their robustness. Here we propose a general framework to classify stable 2D Dirac semimetals in spin-orbit coupled systems having the combined time-reversal and inversion symmetries, and show the existence of the stable Dirac points in 2D antiferromagnetic semimetals. Compared to 3D Dirac semimetals which fall into two distinct classes, Dirac semimetals in 2D with combined time-reversal and inversion symmetries belong to a single class which is closely related to the nonsymmorphic space-group symmetries. We further provide a concrete model in antiferromagnetic semimetals which supports symmetry-protected 2D Dirac points. The symmetry breaking in such systems leads to 2D chiral topological states such as quantum anomalous Hall insulator and chiral topological superconductor phases.",

    "abstract": "MXenes, which constitute a kind of graphene-like material, have been intensively investigated due to their applications in future nanoelectronics technology. These MXenes are either metallic or semiconducting, whereas Dirac cones similar to graphene have rarely been reported. Using first-principles calculations, we proposed a new MXene, namely Zr2Si, whose antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state exhibited in these calculations anisotropic Dirac cones with Fermi velocities comparable to that in graphene. The Dirac spectrum here was determined to arise mainly from the dx2-y2 and dz2 orbitals of Zr atoms. Additionally, the Dirac cones can be gapped when taking the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) and Coulomb repulsive interaction (U) into account, which opens an avenue for using the Zr2Si MXene for electronics applications.",

    "abstract": "We report infrared studies of AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Sr), two representative parent compounds of iron-arsenide superconductors, at magnetic fields (B) up to 17.5 T. Optical transitions between Landau levels (LLs) were observed in the antiferromagnetic states of these two parent compounds. Our observation of a \\surdB dependence of the LL transition energies, the zero-energy intercepts at B=0 T under the linear extrapolations of the transition energies and the energy ratio (\\sim2.4) between the observed LL transitions, combined with the linear band dispersions in two-dimensional (2D) momentum space obtained by theoretical calculations, demonstrates the existence of massless Dirac fermions in the antiferromagnet BaFe2As2. More importantly, the observed dominance of the zeroth-LL-related absorption features and the calculated bands with extremely weak dispersions along the momentum direction kz indicate that massless Dirac fermions in BaFe2As2 are 2D. Furthermore, we find that the total substitution of the barium atoms in BaFe2As2 by strontium atoms not only maintains 2D massless Dirac fermions in this system, but also enhances their Fermi velocity, which supports that the Dirac points in iron-arsenide parent compounds are topologically protected.",

    "abstract": "Parity-time symmetry plays an essential role for the formation of Dirac states in Dirac semimetals. So far, all of the experimentally identified topologically nontrivial Dirac semimetals (DSMs) possess both parity and time reversal symmetry. The realization of magnetic topological DSMs remains a major issue in topological material research. Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, it is ascertained that band inversion induces a topologically nontrivial ground state in EuCd2As2. As a result, ideal magnetic Dirac fermions with simplest double cone structure near the Fermi level emerge in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase. The magnetic order breaks time reversal symmetry, but preserves inversion symmetry. The double degeneracy of the Dirac bands is protected by a combination of inversion, time-reversal, and an additional translation operation. Moreover, the calculations show that a deviation of the magnetic moments from the c-axis leads to the breaking of C3 rotation symmetry, and thus, a small bandgap opens at the Dirac point in the bulk. In this case, the system hosts a novel state containing three different types of topological insulator: axion insulator, AFM topological crystalline insulator (TCI), and higher order topological insulator. The results provide an enlarged platform for the quest of topological Dirac fermions in a magnetic system.",

    "abstract": "We used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory calculations to study the electronic properties of MnBi2Te4, a material that was predicted to be an intrinsic antiferromagnetic (AFM) topological insulator. In striking contrast to earlier literature showing a full gap opening between two surface band manifolds on the (0001) surface, we observed a gapless Dirac surface state with a Dirac point sitting at EB=-280meV. Furthermore, our ARPES data revealed the existence of a second Dirac cone sitting closer to the Fermi level. Surprisingly, these surface states remain intact across the AFM transition. The presence of gapless Dirac states in this material may be caused by different ordering at the surface from the bulk or weaker magnetic coupling between the bulk and surface. Whereas the surface Dirac cones seem to be remarkably insensitive to the AFM ordering most likely due to weak coupling to magnetism, we did observe a splitting of the bulk band accompanying the AFM transition. With a moderately high ordering temperature and interesting gapless Dirac surface states, MnBi2Te4 provides a unique platform for studying the interplay between magnetic ordering and topology.",

    "abstract": "We investigate an effective model of proximity modified graphene (or symmetrylike materials) with broken time-reversal symmetry. We predict the appearance of quantum anomalous Hall phases by computing bulk band gap and Chern numbers for benchmark combinations of system parameters. Allowing for staggered exchange field enables quantum anomalous Hall effect in flat graphene with Chern number C=1. We explicitly show edge states in zigzag and armchair nanoribbons and explore their localization behavior. Remarkably, the combination of staggered intrinsic spin-orbit and uniform exchange coupling gives topologically protected (unlike in time-reversal systems) pseudohelical states, whose spin is opposite in opposite zigzag edges. Rotating the magnetization from out of plane to in plane makes the system trivial, allowing us to control topological phase transitions. We also propose, using density functional theory, a material platform—graphene on Ising antiferromagnet MnPSe3—to realize staggered exchange (pseudospin Zeeman) coupling.",

    "abstract": "Using first-principles combined with quantum transport calculations, we predict that graphene sandwiched between insulating monolayers of Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ ferromagnet and WS$_2$ transition-metal dichalcogenide will exhibit spin-orbit torque (SOT) when unpolarized charge current is injected parallel to interfaces of Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$/graphene/WS$_2$ van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. Although graphene by itself is nonmagnetic and it has negligible spin-orbit coupling (SOC), both of which are required for the SOT phenomenon, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ induces proximity magnetism into graphene while WS$_2$ concurrently imprints valley-Zeeman and Rashba SOCs in it. Unlike SOT on conventional metallic ferromagnets brought into contact with normal materials supplying strong SOC, the predicted SOT on such doubly proximitized graphene can be tuned by up to two orders of magnitude via combined top and back electrostatic gates. The vdW heterostructure also reveals how damping-like component of the SOT vector can arise purely from interfaces and, therefore, even in the absence of any spin Hall current from the bulk of a material with strong SOC. The SOT-driven dynamics of proximity magnetization moves it from out-of-plane to in-plane direction which opens a gap in graphene and leads to zero off current and diverging on/off ratio in such SOT field-effect transistor.",

The anomalous Hall conductance has magnitude of \\sim0.09(2e2/h) at low temperatures and is measurable up to \\sim300 K. Our observations indicate not only proximity-induced ferromagnetism in graphene/YIG with a large exchange interaction, but also enhanced spin-orbit coupling that is believed to be inherently weak in ideal graphene. The proximity-induced ferromagnetic order in graphene can lead to novel transport phenomena such as the quantized AHE which are potentially useful for spintronics.",

    "abstract": "We present a direct measurement of the exchange interaction in room temperature ferromagnetic graphene. We study the spin transport in exfoliated graphene on an yttrium–iron–garnet substrate where the observed spin precession clearly indicates the presence and strength of an exchange field that is an unambiguous evidence of induced ferromagnetism. We describe the results with a modified Bloch diffusion equation and extract an average exchange field of the order of 0.2 T. Further, we demonstrate that a proximity induced 2D ferromagnet can efficiently modulate a spin current by controlling the direction of the exchange field. These findings can create a building block for magnetic-gate tuneable spin transport in one-atom-thick spintronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Atomic vacancies have a strong impact in the mechanical, electronic, and magnetic properties of graphenelike materials. By artificially generating isolated vacancies on a graphite surface and measuring their local density of states on the atomic scale, we have shown how single vacancies modify the electronic properties of this graphenelike system. Our scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, complemented by tight-binding calculations, reveal the presence of a sharp electronic resonance at the Fermi energy around each single graphite vacancy, which can be associated with the formation of local magnetic moments and implies a dramatic reduction of the charge carriers’ mobility. While vacancies in single layer graphene lead to magnetic couplings of arbitrary sign, our results show the possibility of inducing a macroscopic ferrimagnetic state in multilayered graphene just by randomly removing single C atoms.",

    "abstract": "This review compiles results of experimental and theoretical studies on thin films and quantum structures of semiconductors with randomly distributed Mn ions, which exhibit spintronic functionalities associated with collective ferromagnetic spin ordering. Properties of p-type Mn-containing III-V as well as II-VI, IV-VI, V2-VI3, I-II-V, and elemental group IV semiconductors are described, paying particular attention to the most thoroughly investigated system (Ga,Mn)As that supports the hole-mediated ferromagnetic order up to 190 K for the net concentration of Mn spins below 10%. Multilayer structures showing efficient spin injection and spin-related magnetotransport properties as well as enabling magnetization manipulation by strain, light, electric fields, and spin currents are presented together with their impact on metal spintronics. The challenging interplay between magnetic and electronic properties in topologically trivial and nontrivial systems is described, emphasizing the entangled roles of disorder and correlation at the carrier localization boundary. Finally, the case of dilute magnetic insulators is considered, such as (Ga,Mn)N, where low-temperature spin ordering is driven by short-ranged superexchange that is ferromagnetic for certain charge states of magnetic impurities.",

    "abstract": "Spin-based technologies, in the form of magnetic compasses, have existed for thousands of years. However, it is only in the last century that the concept of spin, as a pure quantum phenomenon, was established, paving the way for new applications exploiting its quantum mechanical properties. This chapter introduces the underlying mechanisms behind spin ordering in magnetic materials, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) limit, and reviews historical milestones in the development of “spintronics” and electronic devices utilizing spin. Initially studied for fundamental physical interest, spintronic applications quickly came to prominence following the discovery of giant magnetoresistance and the rediscovery of tunneling magnetoresistance in metallic architectures. The desire to integrate these phenomena with the existing semiconductor-based technologies used in the computing industry has inspired intensive study of spintronics within semiconductor materials. Notable developments include the spin field-effect transistor and nonlocal device geometries. Following the discovery of novel electronic properties of graphene, there has been a drive to harness similar properties–with the addition of spin-control–in van der Waals or 2D materials, resulting in several families of 2D magnetic materials known today.",

    "abstract": "The electronic properties of ultrathin crystals of molybdenum disulfide consisting of N=1,2,…,6 S-Mo-S monolayers have been investigated by optical spectroscopy. Through characterization by absorption, photoluminescence, and photoconductivity spectroscopy, we trace the effect of quantum confinement on the material’s electronic structure. With decreasing thickness, the indirect band gap, which lies below the direct gap in the bulk material, shifts upwards in energy by more than 0.6 eV. This leads to a crossover to a direct-gap material in the limit of the single monolayer. Unlike the bulk material, the MoS2 monolayer emits light strongly. The freestanding monolayer exhibits an increase in luminescence quantum efficiency by more than a factor of 104 compared with the bulk material.",

    "abstract": "We show that inversion symmetry breaking together with spin-orbit coupling leads to coupled spin and valley physics in monolayers of MoS2 and other group-VI dichalcogenides, making possible controls of spin and valley in these 2D materials. The spin-valley coupling at the valence-band edges suppresses spin and valley relaxation, as flip of each index alone is forbidden by the valley-contrasting spin splitting. Valley Hall and spin Hall effects coexist in both electron-doped and hole-doped systems. Optical interband transitions have frequency-dependent polarization selection rules which allow selective photoexcitation of carriers with various combination of valley and spin indices. Photoinduced spin Hall and valley Hall effects can generate long lived spin and valley accumulations on sample boundaries. The physics discussed here provides a route towards the integration of valleytronics and spintronics in multivalley materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking.",

Here we review the state-of-the-art of 2D materials beyond graphene. Initially, we will outline the different chemical classes of 2D materials and discuss the various strategies to prepare single-layer, few-layer, and multilayer assembly materials in solution, on substrates, and on the wafer scale. Additionally, we present an experimental guide for identifying and characterizing single-layer-thick materials, as well as outlining emerging techniques that yield both local and global information. We describe the differences that occur in the electronic structure between the bulk and the single layer and discuss various methods of tuning their electronic properties by manipulating the surface. Finally, we highlight the properties and advantages of single-, few-, and many-layer 2D materials in field-effect transistors, spin- and valley-tronics, thermoelectrics, and topological insulators, among many other applications.",

    "abstract": "First-principles calculations are performed to study the electronic and magnetic properties of VX2 monolayers (X = S, Se). Our results unveil that VX2 monolayers exhibit exciting ferromagnetic behavior, offering evidence of the existence of magnetic behavior in pristine 2D monolayers. Furthermore, interestingly, both the magnetic moments and strength of magnetic coupling increase rapidly with increasing isotropic strain from -5% to 5% for VX2 monolayers. It is proposed that the strain-dependent magnetic moment is related to the strong ionic–covalent bonds, while both the ferromagnetism and the variation in strength of magnetic coupling with strain arise from the combined effects of both through-bond and through-space interactions. These findings suggest a new route to facilitate the design of nanoelectronic devices for complementing graphene.",

    "abstract": "Quantum systems in confined geometries are host to novel physical phenomena. Examples include quantum Hall systems in semiconductors and Dirac electrons in graphene. Interest in such systems has also been intensified by the recent discovery of a large enhancement in photoluminescence quantum efficiency and a potential route to valleytronics in atomically thin layers of transition metal dichalcogenides, MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te), which are closely related to the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition in monolayers. Here, we report the first direct observation of the transition from indirect to direct bandgap in monolayer samples by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on high-quality thin films of MoSe2 with variable thickness, grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The band structure measured experimentally indicates a stronger tendency of monolayer MoSe2 towards a direct bandgap, as well as a larger gap size, than theoretically predicted. Moreover, our finding of a significant spin-splitting of \\sim180 meV at the valence band maximum of a monolayer MoSe2 film could expand its possible application to spintronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic materials enjoy an envious position in the area of data storage, electronics, and even in biomedical field. This review provides an overview of low-dimensional magnetism in graphene, h-BN, and carbon nitrides, which originates from defects like vacancy, adatom, doping, and dangling bonds. In transition metal dichalcogenides, a tunable magnetism comes from doping, strain, and vacancy/defects, and these materials offer spintronics, as well as photoelectronic potentials, since they have an additional degree of freedom called valley state (e.g. MoS2). Strain- and layer-dependent magnetic ordering has been observed in layered compounds like CrXTe3, CrI3, and trisulfides. The magnetism in 2D oxides like MoO3, Ni(OH)2,and perovskites are also interesting as they are potential candidates for next-generation devices having faster processing and large data storage capacity. Quasi 2D magnetism in MXene and in atomically thin materials supported on 3D materials will also be discussed. Finally, some of the challenges related to the control of defects and imperfections in 2D lattice, promising approaches to overcome them will be covered.",

    "abstract": "Based on the s–d interaction model for dilute magnetic alloys we have calculated the scattering probability of the conduction electrons to the second Born approximation. Because of the dynamical character of the localized spin system, the Pauli principle should be taken into account in the intermediate states of the second order terms. Thus the effect of the Fermi sphere is involved in the scattering probability and gives rise to a singular term in the resistivity which involves c log T as a factor, where c is the concentration of impurity atoms. When combined with the lattice resistivity, this gives rise to a resistance minimum, provided the s–d exchange integral J is negative. The temperature at which the minimum ccurs is proportional to c1/5 and the depth of the minimum to c, as is observed. The predicted log T dependence is tested with available experiments and is confirmed. The value of J to have fit with experiments is about -0.2 ev, which is of reasonable magnitude. Our conclusion is that J should be negative in alloys which show a resistance minimum. It is argued that the resistance minimum is a result of the sharp Fermi surface.",

    "abstract": "The linear response theory has given a general proof of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem which states that the linear response of a given system to an external perturbation is expressed in terms of fluctuation properties of the system in thermal equilibrium. This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "We show that the fundamental time-reversal invariant (TRI) insulator exists in 4+1 dimensions, where the effective-field theory is described by the (4+1)-dimensional Chern-Simons theory and the topological properties of the electronic structure are classified by the second Chern number. These topological properties are the natural generalizations of the time reversal-breaking quantum Hall insulator in 2+1 dimensions. The TRI quantum spin Hall insulator in 2+1 dimensions and the topological insulator in 3+1 dimensions can be obtained as descendants from the fundamental TRI insulator in 4+1 dimensions through a dimensional reduction procedure. The effective topological field theory and the Z2 topological classification for the TRI insulators in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions are naturally obtained from this procedure. All physically measurable topological response functions of the TRI insulators are completely described by the effective topological field theory. Our effective topological field theory predicts a number of measurable phenomena, the most striking of which is the topological magnetoelectric effect, where an electric field generates a topological contribution to the magnetization in the same direction, with a universal constant of proportionality quantized in odd multiples of the fine-structure constant \\alpha =e^2/\\hbar c. Finally, we present a general classification of all topological insulators in various dimensions and describe them in terms of a unified topological Chern-Simons field theory in phase space.",

    "abstract": "When a ferromagnet is deposited on the surface of a topological insulator the topologically protected surface state develops a gap and becomes a two-dimensional quantum Hall liquid. We demonstrate that the Hall current in such a liquid, induced by an external electric field, can have a dramatic effect on the magnetization dynamics of the ferromagnet by changing the effective anisotropy field. This change is dissipationless and may be substantial even in weakly spin-orbit coupled ferromagnets. We study the possibility of dissipationless current-induced magnetization reversal in monolayer-thin, insulating ferromagnets with a soft perpendicular anisotropy and discuss possible applications of this effect.",

    "abstract": "We propose a model ferromagnet based on the Dirac Hamiltonian in three spatial dimensions, and study its transport properties which include anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and anomalous Hall (AH) effect. This relativistic extension allows two kinds of ferromagnetic order parameters, denoted by M and S, which are distinguished by the relative sign between the positive- and negative-energy states (at zero momentum) and become degenerate in the nonrelativistic limit. Because of the relativistic coupling between the spin and the orbital motion, both M and S induce anisotropic deformations of the energy dispersion (and the Fermi surfaces) but in mutually opposite ways. The AMR is determined primarily by the anisotropy of the Fermi surface (group velocity), and secondarily by the anisotropy of the damping; the latter becomes important for M=\\pmS, where the Fermi surfaces are isotropic. Even when the chemical potential lies in the gap, the AH conductivity is found to take a finite nonquantized value \\sigma \\_{ij}=-(\\alpha /3\\pi ^2\\hbar )\\epsilon \\_{ijk}S\\_k, where \\alpha is the (effective) fine structure constant. This offers an example of Hall insulator in three spatial dimensions.",

By solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the presence of a charge current, we find current-induced magnetization dynamics and discuss the possibility of magnetization reversal.

    "abstract": "We investigate the magnetization dynamics that arises when a thin-film ferromagnet is deposited on a topological insulator (TI), focusing in particular on domain-wall motion via current and the possibility of a spin-wave torque acting on the magnetization. We show analytically that the coupling between the magnetic domain wall and the TI removes the degeneracy of the wall profile with respect to its chirality and topological charge. Moreover, we find that the threshold for Walker breakdown of domain-wall motion is substantially increased and determined by the interaction with the TI, allowing for higher attainable wall velocities than in the conventional case where the hard-axis anisotropy determines the Walker threshold. Finally, we show that the allowed modes of spin-wave excitations and the ensuing magnetization dynamics in the presence of a TI coupling enable a magnonic torque acting even on homogeneous magnetization textures. Our results indicate that the TI-ferromagnet interaction has a similar effect on the magnetization dynamics as an intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in ferromagnets.",

Expressing exchange coupling between the localized magnetic moments and Dirac electrons in terms of the electrons’ out-of-plane orbital and spin magnetizations, we relate the thermodynamic properties of a general ferromagnetic spin texture to the physics in the zeroth Landau level. Persistent currents carried by Dirac electrons endow the magnetic texture with a Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interaction, which exhibits a universal scaling form as a function of electron temperature, chemical potential, and the time-reversal symmetry breaking gap. In addition, the orbital motion of electrons establishes a direct magnetoelectric coupling between the unscreened electric field and local magnetic order, which furnishes complex long-ranged interactions within the magnetic film.",

    "abstract": "We derive diffusion equations, which describe spin-charge coupled transport on the helical metal surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator. The main feature of these equations is a large magnitude of the spin-charge coupling, which leads to interesting and observable effects. In particular, we predict a new magnetoresistance effect, which manifests in a non-Ohmic correction to a voltage drop between a ferromagnetic spin-polarized electrode and a nonmagnetic electrode, placed on top of the helical metal. This correction is proportional to the cross product of the spin polarization of the ferromagnetic electrode and the charge current between the two electrodes. We also demonstrate tunability of this effect by applying a gate voltage, which makes it possible to operate the proposed device as a transistor.",

    "abstract": "We discuss a current dynamics on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator induced by magnetization precession of an attached ferromagnet. It is found that the magnetization dynamics generates a direct charge current when the precession axis is within the surface plane. This rectification effect is due to a quantum anomaly and is topologically protected. The robustness of the rectification effect against first-varying exchange field and impurities is confirmed by explicit calculation.",

    "abstract": "Resolving the conductance of the topological surface states (TSSs) from the bulk contribution has been a great challenge for studying the transport properties of topological insulators. By developing a nonperturbative diffusion equation that describes fully the spin-charge dynamics in the strong spin-orbit coupling regime, we present a proposal to read the charge transport information of TSSs from its spin dynamics which can be isolated from the bulk contribution by the time-resolved second harmonic generation pump-probe measurement. We demonstrate the qualitatively different Dyaknov-Perel spin relaxation behavior between the TSSs and the two-dimensional spin-orbit coupling electron gas. The decay time of both in-plane and out-of-plane spin polarization is naturally proved to be identical to the charge transport time. The out-of-plane spin dynamics is shown to be in the experimentally reachable regime of the femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy and thereby we suggest experiments to detect the charge transport properties of the TSSs from their unique spin dynamics.",

    "abstract": "We predict that unpolarized charge current injected into a ballistic thin film of prototypical topological insulator (TI) Bi2Se3 will generate a noncollinear spin texture S(r) on its surface. Furthermore, the nonequilibrium spin texture will extend into an \\simeq 2-nm-thick layer below the TI surfaces due to penetration of evanescent wave functions from the metallic surfaces into the bulk of TI. Averaging S(r) over a few angstroms along the longitudinal direction defined by the current flow reveals a large component pointing in the transverse direction. In addition, we find an order of magnitude smaller out-of-plane component when the direction of injected current with respect to Bi and Se atoms probes the largest hexagonal warping of the Dirac-cone dispersion on the TI surface. Our analysis is based on an extension of the nonequilibrium Green’s functions combined with density functional theory (NEGF+DFT) to situations involving noncollinear spins and spin-orbit coupling. We also demonstrate how DFT calculations with a properly optimized local orbital basis set can precisely match putatively more accurate calculations with a plane-wave basis set for the supercell of Bi2Se3.",

    "abstract": "When electrons are subject to a large external magnetic field, the conventional charge quantum Hall effect dictates that an electronic excitation gap is generated in the sample bulk, but metallic conduction is permitted at the boundary. Recent theoretical models suggest that certain bulk insulators with large spin–orbit interactions may also naturally support conducting topological boundary states in the quantum limit, which opens up the possibility for studying unusual quantum Hall-like phenomena in zero external magnetic fields. Bulk Bi1-xSbx single crystals are predicted to be prime candidates for one such unusual Hall phase of matter known as the topological insulator. The hallmark of a topological insulator is the existence of metallic surface states that are higher-dimensional analogues of the edge states that characterize a quantum spin Hall insulator. In addition to its interesting boundary states, the bulk of Bi1-xSbx is predicted to exhibit three-dimensional Dirac particles, another topic of heightened current interest following the new findings in two-dimensional graphene and charge quantum Hall fractionalization observed in pure bismuth. However, despite numerous transport and magnetic measurements on the Bi1-xSbx family since the 1960s, no direct evidence of either topological Hall states or bulk Dirac particles has been found. Here, using incident-photon-energy-modulated angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (IPEM-ARPES), we report the direct observation of massive Dirac particles in the bulk of Bi0.9Sb0.1, locate the Kramers points at the sample’s boundary and provide a comprehensive mapping of the Dirac insulator’s gapless surface electron bands. These findings taken together suggest that the observed surface state on the boundary of the bulk insulator is a realization of the ’topological metal’. They also suggest that this material has potential application in developing next-generation quantum computing devices that may incorporate ’light-like’ bulk carriers and spin-textured surface currents.",

    "abstract": "We theoretically study electrical responses of magnetization in Weyl semimetals. The Weyl semimetal is a new class of topological semimetals, possessing hedgehog type spin textures in momentum space. Because of this peculiar spin texture, an interplay of electron transport and spin dynamics might provide new method to electrical control of magnetization. In this paper, we consider the magnetically doped Weyl semimetals, and systematically study current- and charge-induced spin torque exerted on the local magnetization in three-dimensional Dirac-Weyl metals. We determine all current-induced spin torques including spin-orbit torque, spin-transfer torque, and the so-called $$-term, up to first order with respect to spatial and temporal derivation and electrical currents. We find that spin-transfer torque and $$-term are absent while spin-orbit torque is proportional to the axial current density. We also calculate the charge-induced spin torque microscopically. We find the charge-induced spin torque originates from the chiral anomaly due to the correspondence between spin operators and axial current operators in our model.",

    "abstract": "We theoretically study spin and charge transport induced by a twisted light beam irradiated on a disordered surface of a doped three-dimensional topological insulator (TI). We find that various types of spin vortices are imprinted on the surface of the TI depending on the spin and orbital angular momentum of the incident light. The key mechanism for the appearance of the unconventional spin structure is the spin-momentum locking in the surface state of the TI. Besides, the diffusive transport of electrons under an inhomogeneous electric field causes a gradient of the charge density, which then induces nonlocal charge current and spin density as well as the spin current. We discuss the relation between these quantities within the linear response to the applied electric field using the Keldysh-Green’s function method.",

Combining two Majorana fermions into a single Dirac fermion on a magnetic domain wall allows the neutral Majorana fermions to be probed with charge transport. We will discuss a novel interferometer for Majorana fermions, which probes their Z2 phase. This setup also allows the transmission of neutral Majorana fermions through a point contact to be measured. We introduce a point contact formed by a superconducting junction and show that its transmission can be controlled by the phase difference across the junction. We discuss the feasibility of these experiments using the recently discovered topological insulator Bi2Se3.",

    "abstract": "We study the phases of Bloch insulators with time-reversal symmetry on the basis of the homotopy of the ground-state wave functions in momentum space and find that there are two topological classes characterized by a Z2 invariant. The results are in agreement with a recent study based on counting the zeroes of a certain Pfaffian function related to the ground-state wave function. It is shown that there is a link between the formulation of the topological invariant presented here and the number of robust edge states. A formula is also provided which greatly simplifies the computation of the invariant in a large number of cases. The present study provides guidance for the search of systems which belong to the nontrivial topological class and also establishes a link between the quantum spin Hall effect and the integer quantum Hall effect.",

    "abstract": "The topological invariants of a time-reversal-invariant band structure in two dimensions are multiple copies of the Z2 invariant found by Kane and Mele. Such invariants protect the “topological insulator” phase and give rise to a spin Hall effect carried by edge states. Each pair of bands related by time reversal is described by one Z2 invariant, up to one less than half the dimension of the Bloch Hamiltonians. In three dimensions, there are four such invariants per band pair. The Z2 invariants of a crystal determine the transitions between ordinary and topological insulators as its bands are occupied by electrons. We derive these invariants using maps from the Brillouin zone to the space of Bloch Hamiltonians and clarify the connections between Z2 invariants, the integer invariants that underlie the integer quantum Hall effect, and previous invariants of T-invariant Fermi systems.",

Unlike two dimensions, where a single Z2 topological invariant governs the effect, in three dimensions there are 4 invariants distinguishing 16 phases with two general classes: weak (WTI) and strong (STI) topological insulators. The WTI are like layered 2D QSH states, but are destroyed by disorder. The STI are robust and lead to novel “topological metal” surface states. We introduce a tight binding model which realizes the WTI and STI phases, and we discuss its relevance to real materials, including bismuth.",

    "abstract": "Heterostructures utilizing topological insulators exhibit a remarkable spin-torque efficiency. However, the exact origin of the strong torque, in particular whether it stems from the spin-momentum locking of the topological surface states or rather from spin-Hall physics of the topological-insulator bulk remains unclear. Here, we explore a mechanism of spin-torque generation purely based on the topological surface states. We consider topological-insulator-based bilayers involving ferromagnetic metal (TI/FM) and magnetically doped topological insulators (TI/mdTI), respectively. By ascribing the key theoretical differences between the two setups to location and number of active surface states, we describe both setups within the same framework of spin diffusion of the non-equilibrium spin density of the topological surface states. For the TI/FM bilayer, we find large spin-torque efficiencies of roughly equal magnitude for both in-plane and out-of-plane spin torques. For the TI/mdTI bilayer, we elucidate the dominance of the spin-transfer-like torque. However, we cannot explain the orders of magnitude enhancement reported. Nevertheless, our model gives an intuitive picture of spin-torque generation in topological-insulator-based bilayers and provides theoretical constraints on spin-torque generation due to topological surface states.",

    "abstract": "Spin-transfer torques occur in magnetic heterostructures because the transverse component of a spin current that flows from a nonmagnet into a ferromagnet is absorbed at the interface. We demonstrate this fact explicitly using free-electron models and first-principles electronic structure calculations for real material interfaces. Three distinct processes contribute to the absorption: (1) spin-dependent reflection and transmission, (2) rotation of reflected and transmitted spins, and (3) spatial precession of spins in the ferromagnet. When summed over all Fermi surface electrons, these processes reduce the transverse component of the transmitted and reflected spin currents to nearly zero for most systems of interest. Therefore, to a good approximation, the torque on the magnetization is proportional to the transverse piece of the incoming spin current.",

    "abstract": "We present a microscopic treatment of current-induced torques and thermal fluctuations in itinerant ferromagnets based on a functional formulation of the Keldysh formalism. We find that the nonequilibrium magnetization dynamics is governed by a stochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation with spin transfer torques. We calculate the Gilbert damping parameter $$ and the non-adiabatic spin transfer torque parameter $$ for a model ferromagnet. We find that $$, in agreement with the results obtained using imaginary-time methods of Kohno, Tatara and Shibata [J. Phys. Soc. Japan 75, 113706 (2006)]. We comment on the relationship between $s–d$ and isotropic-Stoner toy models of ferromagnetism and more realistic density-functional-theory models, and on the implications of these relationships for predictions of the $/$ ratio which plays a central role in domain wall motion. Only for a single-parabolic-band isotropic-Stoner model with an exchange splitting that is small compared to the Fermi energy does $/$ approach one. In addition, our microscopic formalism incorporates naturally the fluctuations needed in a nonzero-temperature description of the magnetization. We find that to first order in the applied electric field, the usual form of thermal fluctuations via a phenomenological stochastic magnetic field holds.",

    "abstract": "Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe/CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1-xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.",

It is now shown that even without this spin-polarized injection, a current can induce strong spin torques through the Rashba effect. The efficiency of this process makes it a realistic candidate for room-temperature spintronic applications.</p>",

    "abstract": "We study spin-orbit torques (SOT) in non-degenerate multiband electron systems in the weak disorder limit. Using the two-dimensional Rashba ferromagnet as a model system, we show that the antidamping-like SOT arising from disorder-induced interband-coherence effects is very sensitive to the spin structure of disorder and may have the same sign as the intrinsic SOT in the presence of spin-dependent disorder. While the cancellation of this SOT and the intrinsic one occurs only in the case of spin-independent short-range disorder. In order to have better physical transparency a semiclassical Boltzmann approach equivalent to the Kubo diagrammatic approach in the non- crossing approximation is formulated. This semiclassical framework accounts for the interband- coherence effects induced by both the electric field and static impurity scattering.",

    "abstract": "We develop a phenomenological hydrodynamic theory of coherent magnetic precession coupled to electric currents. Exchange interaction between electron spin and collective magnetic texture produces two reciprocal effects: spin-transfer torque on the magnetic order parameter and the Berry-phase gauge field experienced by the itinerant electrons. The dissipative processes are governed by three coefficients: the ohmic resistance, Gilbert damping of the magnetization, and the “\\beta coefficient” describing viscous coupling between magnetic dynamics and electric current, which stems from spin mistracking of the magnetic order. We develop general magnetohydrodynamic equations and discuss the net dissipation produced by the coupled dynamics. The latter in particular allows us to determine a lower bound on the magnetic-texture resistivity.",

    "abstract": "Quantum optoelectronic devices capable of isolating a target degree of freedom (DoF) from other DoFs have allowed for new applications in modern information technology. Many works on solid-state spintronics have focused on methods to disentangle the spin DoF from the charge DoF1, yet many related issues remain unresolved. Although the recent advent of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has enabled the use of valley pseudospin as an alternative DoF2,3, it is nontrivial to separate the spin DoF from the valley DoF since the time-reversal valley DoF is intrinsically locked with the spin DoF4. Here, we demonstrate lateral TMD–graphene–topological insulator hetero-devices with the possibility of such a DoF-selective measurement. We generate the valley-locked spin DoF via a circular photogalvanic effect in an electric-double-layer WSe2 transistor. The valley-locked spin photocarriers then diffuse in a submicrometre-long graphene layer, and the spin DoF is measured separately in the topological insulator via non-local electrical detection using the characteristic spin–momentum locking. Operating at room temperature, our integrated devices exhibit a non-local spin polarization degree of higher than 0.5, providing the potential for coupled opto-spin–valleytronic applications that independently exploit the valley and spin DoFs.",

    "abstract": "The interaction of subpicosecond laser pulses with magnetically ordered materials has developed into a fascinating research topic in modern magnetism. From the discovery of subpicosecond demagnetization over a decade ago to the recent demonstration of magnetization reversal by a single 40fs laser pulse, the manipulation of magnetic order by ultrashort laser pulses has become a fundamentally challenging topic with a potentially high impact for future spintronics, data storage and manipulation, and quantum computation. Understanding the underlying mechanisms implies understanding the interaction of photons with charges, spins, and lattice, and the angular momentum transfer between them. This paper will review the progress in this field of laser manipulation of magnetic order in a systematic way. Starting with a historical introduction, the interaction of light with magnetically ordered matter is discussed. By investigating metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics, the roles of (nearly) free electrons, charge redistributions, and spin-orbit and spin-lattice interactions can partly be separated, and effects due to heating can be distinguished from those that are not. It will be shown that there is a fundamental distinction between processes that involve the actual absorption of photons and those that do not. It turns out that for the latter, the polarization of light plays an essential role in the manipulation of the magnetic moments at the femtosecond time scale. Thus, circularly and linearly polarized pulses are shown to act as strong transient magnetic field pulses originating from the nonabsorptive inverse Faraday and inverse Cotton-Mouton effects, respectively. The recent progress in the understanding of magneto-optical effects on the femtosecond time scale together with the mentioned inverse, optomagnetic effects promises a bright future for this field of ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic order or femtomagnetism.",

    "abstract": "We report on spin-orbit torque measurements in ferrimagnetic Gd21(Fe90Co10)79 films with bulk perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and thicknesses up to 30nm. The dampinglike and fieldlike torques have been quantified using second harmonic Hall voltage detection. Both torques show an inverse linear dependence on the thickness that is indicative of the interfacial nature of the torques. The spin-Hall angle remains constant over the thickness range of 10 to 30nm Gd21(Fe90Co10)79. Remarkably, we find that this interfacial torque is able to switch a 30-nm-thick Gd21(Fe90Co10)79 film with a reasonably large thermal stability of ?100kBT.",

    "abstract": "We investigate spin orbit torque (SOT) efficiencies and magnetic properties of Pt/GdFeCo/MgO multilayers by varying the thicknesses of GdFeCo and MgO layers. Our studies indicate that the ferrimagnetism in the GdFeCo alloy is considerably influenced by both thicknesses due to the diffusion of Gd atoms toward the MgO layer. Comparing to conventional Pt/ferromagnet/MgO structures, the Pt/GdFeCo/MgO exhibits a lower efficiency of SOTs associated with ferrimagnetic order and a similar magnitude of magnetic damping. The previous models that have been developed for rigid ferromagnets are inappropriate to analyze our experimental data, leading to an unphysical consequence of spin transmission larger than unity. Our results imply that the heavy-metal/ferrimagnet system is quite different from heavy-metal/ferromagnet systems in terms of magnetic dynamical modes, spin angular momentum transfer, and relaxation processes.",

There is evidence of half-metallicity up to x = 0.7, and compensation of the two Mn sublattice moments is observed at specific compositions and temperatures, leading to a zero-moment half metal. There are potential benefits for using such films with perpendicular anisotropy for spin-torque magnetic tunnel junctions and oscillators, such as low critical current, high tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, insensitivity to external fields and resonance frequency in the THz range.",

The phase is a soft ferrimagnet, with Curie temperature TC = 225 K and magnetization Ms=280 kA m-1, equivalent to 1.65\\muB per formula. Adding ruthenium leads to an increase of TC up to 550 K in cubic Mn2RuxGa films with x = 0.33 and a collapse of the net magnetization. The anomalous Hall effect changes sign at x = 0.5, where the sign of the magnetization changes and the magnetic easy direction flips from in plane to perpendicular to the film. The Mn2Ru0.5Ga compound with a valence electron count of 21 is identified as a zero-moment ferrimagnet with high spin polarization, which shows evidence of half-metallicity.",

    "abstract": "Engineering the electronic band structure of material systems enables the unprecedented exploration of new physical properties that are absent in natural or as-synthetic materials. Half metallicity, an intriguing physical property arising from the metallic nature of electrons with singular spin polarization and insulating for oppositely polarized electrons, holds a great potential for a 100% spin-polarized current for high-efficiency spintronics. Conventionally synthesized thin films hardly sustain half metallicity inherited from their 3D counterparts. A fundamental challenge, in systems of reduced dimensions, is the almost inevitable spin-mixed edge or surface states in proximity to the Fermi level. Here, we predict electric field-induced half metallicity in bilayer A-type antiferromagnetic van der Waals crystals (i.e., intralayer ferromagnetism and interlayer antiferromagnetism), by employing density functional theory calculations on vanadium diselenide. Electric fields lift energy levels of the constituent layers in opposite directions, leading to the gradual closure of the gap of singular spin-polarized states and the opening of the gap of the others. We show that a vertical electrical field is a generic and effective way to achieve half metallicity in A-type antiferromagnetic bilayers and realize the spin field effect transistor. The electric field-induced half metallicity represents an appealing route to realize 2D half metals and opens opportunities for nanoscale highly efficient antiferromagnetic spintronics for information processing and storage.",

    "abstract": "We formulate a general microscopic approach to spin-orbit torques in thin ferromagnet/heavy-metal bilayers in linear response to electric current or electric field. The microscopic theory we develop avoids the notion of spin currents and spin-Hall effect. Instead, the torques are directly related to a local spin polarization of conduction electrons, which is computed from generalized Kubo-Středa formulas. A symmetry analysis provides a one-to-one correspondence between polarization susceptibility tensor components and different torque terms in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for magnetization dynamics. The spin-orbit torques arising from Rashba or Dresselhaus type of spin-orbit interaction are shown to have different symmetries. We analyze these spin-orbit torques microscopically for a generic electron model in the presence of an arbitrary smooth magnetic texture. For a model with spin-independent disorder we find a major cancellation of the torques. In this case the only remaining torque corresponds to the magnetization-independent Edelstein effect. Furthermore, our results are applied to analyze the dynamics of a skyrmion under the action of electric current.",

    "abstract": "Silicene (a monolayer of silicon atoms) is a two-dimensional topological insulator (TI) that undergoes a topological phase transition to a band insulator under external electric field Ez. We investigate a photoinduced topological phase transition from a TI to another TI by changing its topological class by irradiating circular polarized light at fixed Ez. The band structure is modified by photon dressing with a new dispersion, where the topological property is altered. By increasing the intensity of light at Ez=0, a photoinduced quantum Hall insulator is realized. Its edge modes are anisotropic chiral, in which the velocities of up and down spins are different. At Ez>Ecr with a certain critical field Ecr, a photoinduced spin-polarized quantum Hall insulator emerges. This is a new state of matter, possessing one Chern number and one-half spin-Chern numbers. We newly discover a single Dirac-cone state along a phase boundary. A distinctive hallmark of the state is that one of the two Dirac valleys is closed and the other open.",

    "abstract": "We present a microscopic theory to give a physical picture of the formation of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in magnetized graphene coupled with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Based on a continuum model at valley K or K’, we show that there exist two distinct physical origins of the QAH effect at two different limits. For large exchange field M, the quantization of Hall conductance in the absence of Landau-level quantization can be regarded as a summation of the topological charges carried by skyrmions from real-spin textures and merons from AB sublattice pseudospin textures, while for strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling \\lambdaR, the four-band low-energy model Hamiltonian is reduced to a two-band extended Haldane model, giving rise to a nonzero Chern number C=1 at either K or K’. In the presence of staggered AB sublattice potential U, a topological phase transition occurs at U=M from a QAH phase to a quantum valley Hall phase. We further find that the band gap responses at K and K’ are different when \\lambdaR, M, and U are simultaneously considered. We also show that the QAH phase is robust against weak intrinsic spin-orbit coupling \\lambdaSO, and it transitions to a trivial phase when \\lambdaSO>(M2+\\lambdaR2+M)/2. Moreover, we use a tight-binding model to reproduce the ab initio method obtained band structures through doping magnetic atoms on 33 and 44 supercells of graphene, and explain the physical mechanisms of opening a nontrivial bulk gap to realize the QAH effect in different supercells of graphene.",

We show that this phase is associated with a novel Z2 topological invariant, which distinguishes it from an ordinary insulator. The Z2 classification, which is defined for time reversal invariant Hamiltonians, is analogous to the Chern number classification of the quantum Hall effect.

    "abstract": "Kwant is a Python package for numerical quantum transport calculations. It aims to be a user-friendly, universal, and high-performance toolbox for the simulation of physical systems of any dimensionality and geometry that can be described by a tight-binding model. Kwant has been designed such that the natural concepts of the theory of quantum transport (lattices, symmetries, electrodes, orbital/spin/electron-hole degrees of freedom) are exposed in a simple and transparent way. Defining a new simulation setup is very similar to describing the corresponding mathematical model. Kwant offers direct support for calculations of transport properties (conductance, noise, scattering matrix), dispersion relations, modes, wave functions, various Green’s functions, and out-of-equilibrium local quantities. Other computations involving tight-binding Hamiltonians can be implemented easily thanks to its extensible and modular nature. Kwant is free software available at http://kwant-project.org/.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that the nontrivial magnetic texture of antiferromagnetic Skyrmions (AFM Sks) promotes a nonvanishing topological spin Hall effect (TSHE) on the flowing electrons. This effect results in a substantial enhancement of the nonadiabatic torque and, hence, improves the Skyrmion mobility. This nonadiabatic torque increases when decreasing the Skyrmion size, and, therefore, scaling down results in a much higher torque efficiency. In clean AFM Sks, we find a significant boost of the TSHE close to the van Hove singularity. Interestingly, this effect is enhanced away from the band gap in the presence of nonmagnetic interstitial defects. Furthermore, unlike their ferromagnetic counterpart, the TSHE in AFM Sks increases with an increase in the disorder strength, thus opening promising avenues for materials engineering of this effect.",

    "abstract": "We theoretically investigate the dynamics of antiferromagnetic domain walls driven by spin-orbit torques in antiferromagnet–heavy-metal bilayers. We show that spin-orbit torques drive antiferromagnetic domain walls much faster than ferromagnetic domain walls. As the domain wall velocity approaches the maximum spin-wave group velocity, the domain wall undergoes Lorentz contraction and emits spin waves in the terahertz frequency range. The interplay between spin-orbit torques and the relativistic dynamics of antiferromagnetic domain walls leads to the efficient manipulation of antiferromagnetic spin textures and paves the way for the generation of high frequency signals from antiferromagnets.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic skyrmions are particle-like topological excitations in ferromagnets, which have the topo-logical number Q = \\pm 1 and hence show the skyrmion Hall effect (SkHE) due to the Magnus force effect originating from the topology. Here, we propose the counterpart of the magnetic skyrmion in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) system, that is, the AFM skyrmion, which is topologically protected but without showing the SkHE. Two approaches for creating the AFM skyrmion have been described based on micromagnetic lattice simulations: (i) by injecting a vertical spin-polarized current to a nanodisk with the AFM ground state; (ii) by converting an AFM domain-wall pair in a nanowire junction. It is demonstrated that the AFM skyrmion, driven by the spin-polarized current, can move straightly over long distance, benefiting from the absence of the SkHE. Our results will open a new strategy on designing the novel spintronic devices based on AFM materials.",

    "abstract": "Skyrmions are topologically protected entities in magnetic materials which have the potential to be used in spintronics for information storage and processing. However, Skyrmions in ferromagnets have some intrinsic difficulties which must be overcome to use them for spintronic applications, such as the inability to move straight along current. We show that Skyrmions can also be stabilized and manipulated in antiferromagnetic materials. An antiferromagnetic Skyrmion is a compound topological object with a similar but of opposite sign spin texture on each sublattice, which, e.g., results in a complete cancellation of the Magnus force. We find that the composite nature of antiferromagnetic Skyrmions gives rise to different dynamical behavior due to both an applied current and temperature effects.",

    "abstract": "We derive a phenomenological theory of current-induced staggered magnetization dynamics in antiferromagnets. The theory captures the reactive and dissipative current-induced torques and the conventional effects of magnetic fields and damping. A Walker ansatz describes the dc current-induced domain-wall motion when there is no dissipation. If magnetic damping and dissipative torques are included, the Walker ansatz remains robust when the domain wall moves slowly. As in ferromagnets, the domain-wall velocity is proportional to the ratio between the dissipative torque and the magnetization damping. In addition, a current-driven antiferromagnetic domain wall acquires a net magnetic moment.",

    "abstract": "Antiferromagnets are robust to external electric and magnetic fields, and hence are seemingly uncontrollable. Recent studies, however, realized the electrical manipulations of antiferromagnets by virtue of the antiferromagnetic Edelstein effect. We present a general symmetry analysis of electrically switchable antiferromagnets based on group-theoretical approaches. Furthermore, we identify a direct relation between switchable antiferromagnets and the ferrotoroidic order. The concept of ferrotoroidic order clarifies the unidirectional nature of switchable antiferromagnets and provides a criterion for the controllability of antiferromagnets. The scheme paves a way for perfect writing and reading of switchable antiferromagnets.",

Unlike ferromagnetic heterostructures where the Dirac cone is gapped due to time-reversal symmetry breaking, here the Dirac cone is preserved. We demonstrate the existence of a staggered spin density corresponding to a dampinglike torque which is quite robust against scalar impurities when the transport energy is such that the transport is confined to the topological insulator surface. We show the contribution to the nonequilibrium spin density due to both surface and bulk topological insulator bands. Finally, we show that the torques in topological insulator/antiferromagnet heterostructures exhibit an angular dependence that is consistent with the standard spin-orbit torque obtained in Rashba system with some additional structure arising from the interfacial coupling.",

    "abstract": "The development of compact and tunable room temperature sources of coherent THz-frequency signals would open a way for numerous new applications. The existing approaches to THz-frequency generation based on superconductor Josephson junctions (JJ), free electron lasers, and quantum cascades require cryogenic temperatures or/and complex setups, preventing the miniaturization and wide use of these devices. We demonstrate theoretically that a bi-layer of a heavy metal (Pt) and a bi-axial antiferromagnetic (AFM) dielectric (NiO) can be a source of a coherent THz signal. A spin-current flowing from a DC-current-driven Pt layer and polarized along the hard AFM anisotropy axis excites a non-uniform in time precession of magnetizations sublattices in the AFM, due to the presence of a weak easy-plane AFM anisotropy. The frequency of the AFM oscillations varies in the range of 0.1–2.0 THz with the driving current in the Pt layer from 108 A/cm2 to 109 A/cm2. The THz-frequency signal from the AFM with the amplitude exceeding 1 V/cm is picked up by the inverse spin-Hall effect in Pt. The operation of a room-temperature AFM THz-frequency oscillator is similar to that of a cryogenic JJ oscillator, with the energy of the easy-plane magnetic anisotropy playing the role of the Josephson energy.",

Sufficiently large in-plane currents perpendicular to the Néel order trigger spontaneous oscillations at frequencies between the acoustic and the optical eigenmodes. The direction of the driving current determines the chirality of the excitation. When the current exceeds a threshold, the combined effect of spin pumping and current-induced torques introduces a dynamic feedback that sustains steady-state oscillations with amplitudes controllable via the applied current. The ac voltage output is calculated numerically as a function of the dc current input for different feedback strengths.

    "abstract": "We explore routes to realize electrically driven Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons in insulating antiferromagnets. Even in insulating antiferromagnets, the localized spins can strongly couple to itinerant spins in adjacent metals via spin-transfer torque and spin pumping. We describe the formation of steady-state magnon condensates controlled by a spin accumulation polarized along the staggered field in an adjacent normal metal. Two types of magnons, which carry opposite magnetic moments, exist in antiferromagnets. Consequently, and in contrast to ferromagnets, Bose-Einstein condensation can occur for either sign of the spin accumulation. This condensation may occur even at room temperature when the interaction with the normal metal is fast compared to the relaxation processes within the antiferromagnet. In antiferromagnets, the operating frequencies of the condensate are orders of magnitude higher than in ferromagnets.",

    "abstract": "One of the main obstacles that prevents practical applications of antiferromagnets is the difficulty of manipulating the magnetic order parameter. Recently, following the theoretical prediction [J. Železný others, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 157201 (2014)], the electrical switching of magnetic moments in an antiferromagnet was demonstrated [P. Wadley others, Science 351, 587 (2016)]. The switching is due to the so-called spin-orbit torque, which has been extensively studied in ferromagnets. In this phenomena a nonequilibrium spin-polarization exchange coupled to the ordered local moments is induced by current, hence exerting a torque on the order parameter. Here we give a general systematic analysis of the symmetry of the spin-orbit torque in locally and globally noncentrosymmetric crystals. We study when the symmetry allows for a nonzero torque, when is the torque effective, and its dependence on the applied current direction and orientation of magnetic moments. For comparison, we consider both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders. In two representative model crystals we perform microscopic calculations of the spin-orbit torque to illustrate its symmetry properties and to highlight conditions under which the spin-orbit torque can be efficient for manipulating antiferromagnetic moments.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that an antiferromagnet can be employed for a highly efficient electrical manipulation of a ferromagnet. In our study, we use an electrical detection technique of the ferromagnetic resonance driven by an in-plane ac current in a NiFe/IrMn bilayer. At room temperature, we observe antidampinglike spin torque acting on the NiFe ferromagnet, generated by an in-plane current driven through the IrMn antiferromagnet. A large enhancement of the torque, characterized by an effective spin-Hall angle exceeding most heavy transition metals, correlates with the presence of the exchange-bias field at the NiFe/IrMn interface. It highlights that, in addition to the strong spin-orbit coupling, the antiferromagnetic order in IrMn governs the observed phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "We observe the excitation of collective modes in the terahertz (THz) range driven by the recently discovered Néel spin-orbit torques (NSOTs) in the metallic antiferromagnet Mn2Au. Temperature-dependent THz spectroscopy reveals a strong absorption mode centered near 1 THz, which upon heating from 4 to 450 K softens and loses intensity. A comparison with the estimated eigenmode frequencies implies that the observed mode is an in-plane antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR). The AFMR absorption strength exceeds those found in antiferromagnetic insulators, driven by the magnetic field of the THz radiation, by 3 orders of magnitude. Based on this and the agreement with our theory modeling, we infer that the driving mechanism for the observed mode is the current-induced NSOT. Here the electric field component of the THz pulse drives an ac current in the metal, which subsequently drives the AFMR. This electric manipulation of the Néel order parameter at high frequencies makes Mn2Au a prime candidate for antiferromagnetic ultrafast memory applications.",

    "abstract": "Spin-orbit torque (SOT) offers promising approaches to developing energy-efficient memory devices by electric switching of magnetization. Compared to other SOT materials, metallic antiferromagnet (AFM) potentially allows the control of SOT through its magnetic structure. Here, combining the results from neutron diffraction and spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance experiments, we show that the magnetic structure of epitaxially grown L10-IrMn (a collinear AFM) is distinct from the widely presumed bulk one. It consists of twin domains, with the spin axes orienting toward [111] and [-111], respectively. This unconventional magnetic structure is responsible for much larger SOT efficiencies up to 0.60 \\pm 0.04, compared to 0.083 \\pm 0.002 for the polycrystalline IrMn. Furthermore, we reveal that this magnetic structure induces a large isotropic bulk contribution and a comparable anisotropic interfacial contribution to the SOT efficiency. Our findings shed light on the critical roles of bulk and interfacial antiferromagnetism to SOT generated by metallic AFM. Collinear IrMn offers new opportunities for future magnetic memory design as it can be an effective source of spin-orbit torque.

    "abstract": "Efficient electrical switching of antiferromagnets is at the center of their application in high-density and ultrafast nonvolatile memories. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mn2Au with opposite-spin sublattices is a unique metallic material in which the Edelstein effect can induce fieldlike torque switching of the AFM moments. However, the antidamping-torque-induced AFM moment switching remains to be proved in metallic AFM materials. Here, we demonstrate current-induced AFM moment switching in both a (103)-oriented Mn2Au single layer and Mn2Au/Pt heterojunction, detected by the spin Hall magnetoresistance and anisotropic magnetoresistance at room temperature. In (103)-oriented Mn2Au, fieldlike torque induces the alignment of AFM moments perpendicular to the writing current direction. Once the (103)-oriented Mn2Au film is covered by a thin Pt layer, the antidamping torque induced by the spin current from the Pt layer drives the AFM moments of Mn2Au switching toward the direction parallel to the writing current, which is in contrast to the case without Pt. The simultaneous realization of fieldlike torque and antidamping torque in metallic Mn2Au makes it a promising candidate in AFM spintronics.",

In recent years, the discovery of spin–orbit torque has opened a spectrum of opportunities to manipulate the magnetization efficiently. This article presents a review of the historical background and recent literature focusing on spin–orbit torques (SOTs), highlighting the most exciting new scientific results and suggesting promising future research directions. It starts with an introduction and overview of the underlying physics of spin–orbit coupling effects in bulk and at interfaces, and then describes the use of SOTs to control ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Finally, the prospects for the future development of spintronic devices based on SOTs are summarized.",

    "abstract": "Spin-orbit coupling in inversion-asymmetric magnetic crystals and structures has emerged as a powerful tool to generate complex magnetic textures, interconvert charge and spin under applied current, and control magnetization dynamics. Current-induced spin-orbit torques mediate the transfer of angular momentum from the lattice to the spin system, leading to sustained magnetic oscillations or switching of ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic structures. The manipulation of magnetic order, domain walls and skyrmions by spin-orbit torques provides evidence of the microscopic interactions between charge and spin in a variety of materials and opens novel strategies to design spintronic devices with potentially high impact in data storage, nonvolatile logic, and magnonic applications. This paper reviews recent progress in the field of spin-orbitronics, focusing on theoretical models, material properties, and experimental results obtained on bulk noncentrosymmetric conductors and multilayer heterostructures, including metals, semiconductors, and topological insulator systems. Relevant aspects for improving the understanding and optimizing the efficiency of nonequilibrium spin-orbit phenomena in future nanoscale devices are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Antiferromagnets with zero net magnetic moment, strong anti-interference, and ultrafast switching speed are potentially competitive in high-density information storage. The body-centered tetragonal antiferromagnet Mn2Au with opposite-spin sublattices is a unique metallic material for Néel-order spin-orbit-torque (SOT) switching. We investigate the SOT switching in quasiepitaxial (103), (101) and (204) Mn2Au films prepared by a simple magnetron sputtering method. We demonstrate current-induced antiferromagnetic moment switching in all of the prepared Mn2Au films by using a short current pulse at room temperature, whereas differently oriented films exhibit distinguished switching characters. A direction-independent reversible switching is attained in Mn2Au (103) films due to negligible magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, while for Mn2Au (101) and (204) films, the switching is invertible with the current applied along the in-plane easy axis and its vertical axis, but it becomes attenuated seriously during initial switching circles when the current is applied along the hard axis because of the existence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. Besides the fundamental significance, the strong orientation-dependent SOT switching, which is not realized, irrespective of ferromagnet and antiferromagnet, provides versatility for spintronics.",

Using CuMnAs as an example, we formulate symmetry criteria allowing for the coexistence of topological Dirac quasiparticles and Néel spin-orbit torques. We identify the nonsymmorphic crystal symmetry protection of Dirac band crossings whose on and off switching is mediated by the Néel vector reorientation. We predict that this concept verified by minimal model and density functional calculations in the CuMnAs semimetal antiferromagnet can lead to a topological metal-insulator transition driven by the Néel vector and to the topological anisotropic magnetoresistance.",

    "abstract": "We investigate spin transport in two-dimensional ferromagnetic (FTI) and antiferromagnetic (AFTI) topological insulators. In the presence of an in-plane magnetization AFTI supports zero energy modes, which enables topologically protected edge conduction at low energy. We address the nature of current-driven spin torque in these structures and study the impact of spin-independent disorder. Interestingly, upon strong disorder the spin torque develops an antidamping component (i.e., even upon magnetization reversal) along the edges, which could enable current-driven manipulation of the antiferromagnetic order parameter. This antidamping torque decreases when increasing the system size and when the system enters the trivial insulator regime.",

    "abstract": "An applied electric current through a space-inversion asymmetric magnet induces spin-orbit torques (SOTs) on the magnetic moments, which holds much promise for future memory devices. We discuss general Green’s function expressions suitable to compute the linear-response SOT in disordered ferromagnets. The SOT can be decomposed into an even and an odd component with respect to magnetization reversal, where in the limit of vanishing disorder the even SOT is given by the constant Berry curvature of the occupied states, while the odd part exhibits a divergence with respect to disorder strength. Within this formalism, we perform first-principles density-functional theory calculations of the SOT in Co/Pt(111) and Mn/W(001) magnetic bilayers. We find the even and odd torque components to be of comparable magnitude. Moreover, the odd torque depends strongly on an additional capping layer, while the even torque is less sensitive. We show that the even torque is nearly entirely mediated by spin currents in contrast to the odd torque, which can contain an important contribution not due to spin transfer. Our results are in agreement with experiments, showing that our linear-response theory is well-suited for the description of SOTs in complex ferromagnets.",

Based on microscopic transport theory calculations we identify staggered current-induced fields analogous to the intraband and to the intrinsic interband spin-orbit fields previously reported in ferromagnets with a broken inversion-symmetry crystal. To illustrate their rich physics and utility, we consider bulk Mn2Au with the two spin sublattices forming inversion partners, and a 2D square-lattice antiferromagnet with broken structural inversion symmetry modeled by a Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

    "abstract": "In the past five years, most of the paradigmatic concepts employed in spintronics have been replicated substituting ferromagnets by antiferromagnets in the critical parts of the devices. The numerous research efforts directed to manipulate and probe the magnetic moments in antiferromagnets have been gradually established a new and independent field known as antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this paper, we focus on the electrical control and detection of antiferromagnetic moments at a constant temperature. We address separately the experimental results concerning insulating and metallic thin films as they correspond to voltage and electrical current controlled devices, respectively. First, we present results on the voltage control of antiferromagnetic order in insulating thin films. The experiments show that voltage pulses can switch the chirality of a modulated antiferromagnetic structure. Second, we describe the recent advances in metallic antiferromagnetic systems. We present results obtained with the first USB-operated portable device able to perform the nonvolatile electrical current-induced switching of an antiferromagnet combined with magnetoresistive readout at room temperature. We discuss on potential applications that can be realized using antiferromagnetic memory cells.",

Recently, realization of memory devices based on antiferromagnets, in which spin directions periodically alternate from one atomic lattice site to the next has moved research in an alternative direction. We experimentally demonstrate at room temperature that the speed of reversible electrical writing in a memory device can be scaled up to terahertz using an antiferromagnet. A current-induced spin-torque mechanism is responsible for the switching in our memory devices throughout the 12-order-of-magnitude range of writing speeds from hertz to terahertz. Our work opens the path toward the development of memory-logic technology reaching the elusive terahertz band. We demonstrate terahertz electrical writing speed in an antiferromagnetic memory at an energy of the gigahertz speed writing.

    "abstract": "We demonstrate the possibility to drive an antiferromagnetic domain wall at high velocities by fieldlike Néel spin-orbit torques. Such torques arise from current-induced local fields that alternate their orientation on each sublattice of the antiferromagnet and whose orientation depends primarily on the current direction, giving them their fieldlike character. The domain wall velocities that can be achieved by this mechanism are 2 orders of magnitude greater than the ones in ferromagnets. This arises from the efficiency of the staggered spin-orbit fields to couple to the order parameter and from the exchange-enhanced phenomena in antiferromagnetic texture dynamics, which leads to a low domain wall effective mass and the absence of a Walker breakdown limit. In addition, because of its nature, the staggered spin-orbit field can lift the degeneracy between two 180^\\circ rotated states in a collinear antiferromagnet, and it provides a force that can move such walls and control the switching of the states.",

    "abstract": "Antiferromagnets are promising for future spintronic applications owing to their advantageous properties: They are magnetically ordered, but neighboring magnetic moments point in opposite directions, which results in zero net magnetization. This means antiferromagnets produce no stray fields and are insensitive to external magnetic field perturbations. Furthermore, they show intrinsic high frequency dynamics, exhibit considerable spin–orbit and magneto-transport effects. Over the past decade, it has been realized that antiferromagnets have more to offer than just being utilized as passive components in exchange bias applications. This development resulted in a paradigm shift, which opens the pathway to novel concepts using antiferromagnets for spin-based technologies and applications. This article gives a broad perspective on antiferromagnetic spintronics. In particular, the manipulation and detection of antiferromagnetic states by spintronics effects, as well as spin transport and dynamics in antiferromagnetic materials will be discussed. We will also outline current challenges and future research directions in this emerging field.",

    "abstract": "Antiferromagnetic materials could represent the future of spintronic applications thanks to the numerous interesting features they combine: they are robust against perturbation due to magnetic fields, produce no stray fields, display ultrafast dynamics, and are capable of generating large magnetotransport effects. Intense research efforts over the past decade have been invested in unraveling spin transport properties in antiferromagnetic materials. Whether spin transport can be used to drive the antiferromagnetic order and how subsequent variations can be detected are some of the thrilling challenges currently being addressed. Antiferromagnetic spintronics started out with studies on spin transfer and has undergone a definite revival in the last few years with the publication of pioneering articles on the use of spin-orbit interactions in antiferromagnets. This paradigm shift offers possibilities for radically new concepts for spin manipulation in electronics. Central to these endeavors are the need for predictive models, relevant disruptive materials, and new experimental designs. This paper reviews the most prominent spintronic effects described based on theoretical and experimental analysis of antiferromagnetic materials. It also details some of the remaining bottlenecks and suggests possible avenues for future research. This review covers both spin-transfer-related effects, such as spin-transfer torque, spin penetration length, domain-wall motion, and “magnetization” dynamics, and spin-orbit related phenomena, such as (tunnel) anisotropic magnetoresistance, spin Hall, and inverse spin galvanic effects. Effects related to spin caloritronics, such as the spin Seebeck effect, are linked to the transport of magnons in antiferromagnets. The propagation of spin waves and spin superfluids in antiferromagnets is also covered.",

    "abstract": "Manipulating a stubborn magnet Spintronics is an alternative to conventional electronics, based on using the electron’s spin rather than its charge. Spintronic devices, such as magnetic memory, have traditionally used ferromagnetic materials to encode the 1’s and 0’s of the binary code. A weakness of this approach—that strong magnetic fields can erase the encoded information—could be avoided by using antiferromagnets instead of ferromagnets. But manipulating the magnetic ordering of antiferromagnets is tricky. Now, Wadley others have found a way (see the Perspective by Marrows). Running currents along specific directions in the thin films of the antiferromagnetic compound CuMnAs reoriented the magnetic domains in the material. Science, this issue p. 587; see also p. 558 Antiferromagnets are hard to control by external magnetic fields because of the alternating directions of magnetic moments on individual atoms and the resulting zero net magnetization. However, relativistic quantum mechanics allows for generating current-induced internal fields whose sign alternates with the periodicity of the antiferromagnetic lattice. Using these fields, which couple strongly to the antiferromagnetic order, we demonstrate room-temperature electrical switching between stable configurations in antiferromagnetic CuMnAs thin-film devices by applied current with magnitudes of order 106 ampere per square centimeter. Electrical writing is combined in our solid-state memory with electrical readout and the stored magnetic state is insensitive to and produces no external magnetic field perturbations, which illustrates the unique merits of antiferromagnets for spintronics. Transport and optical measurements are used to demonstrate the switching of domains in the antiferromagnetic compound CuMnAs. [Also see Perspective by Marrows] Transport and optical measurements are used to demonstrate the switching of domains in the antiferromagnetic compound CuMnAs. [Also see Perspective by Marrows]",

    "abstract": "In this brief review, we explain the theoretical basis for the notion that spin-transfer torques (STTs) and giant-magnetoresistance effects can, in principle, occur in circuits containing only normal and antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials, and for the notion that antiferromagnets can play a role in STT phenomena in circuits containing both ferromagnetic and AFM elements. We review the experimental literature that provides partial evidence for these AFM spintronic effects but demonstrates that, like exchange-bias effects, they are sensitive to details of interface structure that are not always under experimental control. Finally, we speculate briefly on some strategies that might advance progress.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews spintronics based memories, in particular, magnetic random access memory (MRAM) in a systematic manner. Debuted as a humble 4Mb product by FreeScale in 2006, the MRAM has grown to a 256Mb product of Everspin in 2016. During this period, MRAM has overcome several hurdles and have reached a stage, where the potential for MRAM is very promising. One of the main hurdles that the MRAM overcome between 2006 and 2016 is the way the information is written. The 4Mb MRAM used a magnetic field based switching technology that would be almost impossible to scale below 100nm. The 256Mb MRAM, on the other hand uses a different writing mechanism based on Spin Transfer Torque (STT), which is scalable to very low dimensions. In addition to the difference in the writing mechanism, there has also been a major shift in the storage material. Whereas the 4Mb MRAM used materials with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, the 256Mb MRAM uses materials with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). MRAM based on PMA is also scalable to much higher densities. The paper starts with a brief history of memory technologies, followed by a brief description of the working principles of MRAM for novice. Reading information from MRAM, the technologies, materials and the physics behind reading of bits in MRAM are described in detail. As a next step, the physics and technologies involved in writing information are described. The magnetic field based writing and its limitations are described first, followed by an explanation of STT mechanism. The materials and physics behind storage of information is described next. MRAMs with in-plane magnetization, their layered material structure and the disadvantages are described first, followed by the advantages of MRAMs with perpendicular magnetization, their advantages etc. The technologies to improve writability and potential challenges and reliability issues are discussed next. Some of the future technologies that might help the industry to move beyond the conventional MRAM technology are discussed at the end of the paper, followed by a summary and an outlook.",

It is an applied discipline that is so forward-looking that much of the research that supports it is at the center of basic condensed matter physics. This review provides a perspective on recent developments in switching magnetic moments by spin-polarized currents, electric fields, and photonic fields. Developments in the field continue to be strongly dependent on the exploration and discovery of novel material systems. An array of novel transport and thermoelectric effects dependent on the interplay between spin and charge currents have been explored theoretically and experimentally in recent years.

    "abstract": "Bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) is a topological insulator with metallic surface states (SS) residing in a large bulk bandgap. In experiments, synthesized Bi2Se3 is often heavily n-type doped due to selenium vacancies. Furthermore, it is discovered from experiments on bulk single crystals that Bi2Se3 gets additional n-type doping after exposure to the atmosphere, thereby reducing the relative contribution of SS in total conductivity. In this article, transport measurements on Bi2Se3 nanoribbons provide additional evidence of such environmental doping process. Systematic surface composition analyses by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal fast formation and continuous growth of native oxide on Bi2Se3 under ambient conditions. In addition to n-type doping at the surface, such surface oxidation is likely the material origin of the degradation of topological SS. Appropriate surface passivation or encapsulation may be required to probe topological SS of Bi2Se3 by transport measurements.",

    "abstract": "Strong spin-momentum coupling in topological insulators give rise to topological surface states, protected against disorder scattering by time reversal symmetry. The study of these exotic quantum states not only provides an opportunity to explore fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics such as the spin hall effect, but also lays the foundation for applications in quantum computing to spintronics. Conventional electrical measurements suffer from substantial bulk interference, making it difficult to clearly identify topological surface state from the bulk. We use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to study the temperature-dependent optical behavior of a 23quintuple-thick film of bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) allowing the deconvolution of the surface state response from the bulk. The signatures of the topological surface state at low temperatures (< 30 K) with the optical conductance of Bi2Se3 exhibiting a metallic behavior are observed. Measurement of carrier dynamics, obtain an optical mobility, exceeding 2000 cm2/Vs at 4 K, indicative of a surfacedominated response. A scattering lifetime of ~0.18 ps and a carrier density of 6\\times1012 cm-2 at 4 K were obtained from the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy measurement. The terahertz conductance spectra reveal characteristic features at ~1.9 THz, attributed to the optical phonon mode, which becomes less prominent with falling temperature. The electrical transport measurements reveal weak antilocalization behavior in our Bi2Se3 sample, consistent with the presence of a topological surface state.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs) are new forms of quantum matter that are characterized by their insulating bulk state and exotic metallic surface state, which hosts helical Dirac fermions1-2. Very recently, BiTeCl, one of the polar semiconductors, has been discovered by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to be the first strong inversion asymmetric topological insulator (SIATI). In contrast to the previously discovered 3D TIs with inversion symmetry, the SIATI are expected to exhibit novel topological phenomena, including crystalline-surface-dependent topological surface states, intrinsic topological p-n junctions, and pyroelectric and topological magneto-electric effects3. Here, we report the first transport evidence for the robust topological surface state in the SIATI BiTeCl via observation of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations, which exhibit the 2D nature of the Fermi surface and pi Berry phase. The n = 1 Landau quantization of the topological surface state is observed at B . 12 T without gating, and the Fermi level is only 58.8 meV above the Dirac point, which gives rise to small effective mass, 0.055me, and quite large mobility, 4490 cm2s-1. Our findings will pave the way for future transport exploration of other new topological phenomena and potential applications for strong inversion asymmetric topological insulators.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in spintronics is to find an efficient means to manipulate antiferromagnet (AFM) states, which are inert relative to a uniform magnetic field, due to the vanishingly-small net magnetization. The question is, how does an AFM response to an inhomogeneous field? Here we address the problem through a complete classification of the magnetic forces on an AFM domain wall (DW), revealing the following physical properties: (i) the tiny net magnetization still responses to the field gradient. (ii) the N{́e}el order is sensitive to the field difference between two sublattices. (iii) DW energy has a quadratic dependence on the magnetic field due to its noncollinear structure. Remarkably, the first two factors drive DW to the opposite directions in a nanowire, but the third effect tends to push the DW to the high field region. Consequently, the competition among these three forces can be applied to understand the seemingly-contradictory results on AFM motion in literature. Additionally, our results provide a new route for a speedy manipulating AFM DW; our numerical simulation indicated that for a synthetic antiferromagnet, the DW propagating speed can reach tens of kilometers per second, an order of magnitude higher than that driven by an electric current.",

    "abstract": "We theoretically investigate the dynamics of atomic domain walls (DWs) in antiferromagnets driven by a spin-orbit field. For a DW with the width of a few lattice constants, we identify a Peierls-like pinning effect, with the depinning field exponentially decaying with the DW width, so that a spin-orbit field moderately larger than the threshold can drive the propagation of an atomic DW in a step-wise manner. For a broad DW, the Peierls pinning is negligibly small. However, the external spin-orbit field can induce a fast DW propagation, accompanied by a significant shrinking of its width down to atomic scales. Before stepping into the pinning region, noticeable spin waves are emitted at the tail of the DW. The spin-wave emission event not only broadens the effective width of the DW, but also pushes the DW velocity over the magnonic barrier, which is generally believed to be the relativistic limit of the DW speed. While the existing dynamic theory based on the continuum approximation fails in the atomic scale, we develop an energy conversion theory to interpret the DW dynamics beyond the relativistic limit.",

    "abstract": "It is generally accepted that the fastest way to reorient magnetization is through precessional motion in an external magnetic field1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. In ferromagnets, the application of a magnetic field instantaneously sets spins in motion and, in contrast to the inertial motion of massive bodies, the magnetization can climb over a potential barrier only during the action of a magnetic-field pulse. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally different scenario of spin switching in antiferromagnets, where the exchange interaction between the spins leads to an inertial behaviour. Although the spin orientation hardly changes during the action of an optically generated strong magnetic-field pulse of 100 fs duration, this pulse transfers sufficient momentum to the spin system to overcome the potential barrier and reorient into a new metastable state, long after the action of the stimulus. Such an inertia-based mechanism of spin switching should offer new opportunities for ultrafast recording and processing of magnetically stored information.",

    "abstract": "© 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd. Heat-driven magnetization damping, which is a linear function of a temperature gradient, is predicted in antiferromagnets by considering the sublattice dynamics subjected to a heat-driven spin torque. This points to the possibility of achieving spi n torque oscillator behavior. The model is based on the magnetic Seebeck effect acting on sublattices which are exchange coupled. The heat-driven spin torque is estimated and the feasibility of detecting this effect is discussed.",

    "abstract": "We show how a charge current through a single antiferromagnetic layer can excite and control self-oscillations. Sustained oscillations with tunable amplitudes and frequencies are possible in a variety of geometries using certain classes of non-centrosymmetric materials that exhibit finite dissipative spin-orbit torque. We compute the steady-state phase diagram as a function of the current and spin-orbit torque magnitude. The anisotropic magnetoresistance causes the conversion of the resulting AF oscillations to a terahertz AC output voltage. These findings provide an attractive and novel route to design terahertz antiferromagnetic spin-orbit torque oscillators in simple single-layer structures.",

    "abstract": "A combination of novel technological and fundamental physics prospects has sparked a huge interest in pure spin transport in magnets, starting with ferromagnets and spreading to antiferro- and ferrimagnets. We present a theoretical study of spin transport across a ferrimagnet$|$non-magnetic conductor interface, when a magnetic eigenmode is driven into a coherent state. The obtained spin current expression includes intra- as well as cross-sublattice terms, both of which are essential for a quantitative understanding of spin-pumping. The dc current is found to be sensitive to the asymmetry in interfacial coupling between the two sublattice magnetizations and the mobile electrons, especially for antiferromagnets. We further find that the concomitant shot noise provides a useful tool for probing the quasiparticle spin and interfacial coupling.",
